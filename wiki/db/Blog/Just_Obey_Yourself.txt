If you feel tired

If you shed tears

Stop sorrowing

Stop to stand up

Bring your eyes up to the sky

And find what is real

<br />

Entire human on the world

Not everyone knows you

They disagree

They against

They criticize

They attack

<br />

Ignore them

Out of mind, out of influence

Because your life is yours

Do what you want to do

Be what you want to be
