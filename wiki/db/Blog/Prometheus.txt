Perhaps I will fail my dream? But I decide not to give up. Perhaps my hard work will be proved useless? But I decide not to betray.

I am a round peg in square holes, which means I have no typical options. I am a misfit among troublemakers, which means I have to be crazy. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Obviously, the possibility of my success is unknown and apparently not high, but I have to go onto this way.

I have the chance to change the world, but maybe the fortunate I do not have. There will be someone of similarity with me to change the world, but not exactly who is chosen by fate. I almost have every necessary virtue for my dream, but it has not been clear whether I will be the one. I have my destiny to meet, though undefined yet. I will have my destination to arrive, though unclear yet.

Life is a game, and I have to make every effort to fight. What if I fail and get proved not talented enough? It will make no sense to talk about me, a nameless loser. What if I fail but with enough talent? Unaffordable will such huge loss be.

I must and will try my best to make my ding in the universe, for not only myself but entire human race. Especially since I want to be the next Prometheus.
