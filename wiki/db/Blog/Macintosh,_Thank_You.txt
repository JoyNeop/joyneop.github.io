30 years have passed since Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh to the world, and so far both Macintosh and Apple have been greatly appreciated around the world. Especially, I have benefited considerably from Macintosh, Apple, and Steve Jobs.

Thanks to my decision in later 2010 to get a Mac instead of a PC, which looks really profound now. Therefore, I got amazed by both the graceful hardware and the powerful software. It was the first time that I understood how surprising the combination of humanity and technology can be. Thanks to such experience, I eventually decided to be a designer in UI, though not only UI. I feel like managing everything in my own mind. My first Macintosh was the initial acceleration.

Macintosh is the symbol of that stage and an essential milestone along personal electronic devices' development, where most modern genius are spending their intelligence on, where I will also take part in. Hard to imagine what if I didn't decide to get a Mac. Hard to imagine what if I get a Mac more later. Hard to imagine what if I failed in getting a computer.

Therefore, I appreciate Macintosh much more than others do. My appreciating is beyond admiring, but acknowledging.

An essential encounter, in not only my life, but also this era.
