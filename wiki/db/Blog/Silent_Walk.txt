As expected, the mid-semester exam has done. I have risen by 61 ranks, to the 580th out of about 780 science students in grade 11.

And I have founded Unworsable, which refers to “un-worse-able”, to let people share criticizing about terrible designs. Domain “unworsable.com” was registered at Go Daddy and server was provided with by Jemery Wu. I also have created a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and a Weibo account to promote it.

I have joined a dancing community in school, which is now training a dance that needed me to work on music. I chose and recompose music, and make it suitable for their dance. But unfortunately I have to do more work, just like adding an extra drums track.

Despite memorizable experiences above, these weeks were still not significative. Just like a silent walk in my life, without any lead, pad, accompaniment, or chord. Sounds were disabled.
