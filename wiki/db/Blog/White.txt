Again, snow droped. But, differently, this time, sky was clear. However the color is, snow was always similar, though I get various emotions from snow. And the secrets inside, were buried in snow.

Once more a time, I wrote chatacters on the snowed ground to the north of our class house, by feet. Before, I wrote words like "I love Sm抹茶", but this time I wrote "404 Not Found". It was easy to understand. If anyone asks me which is the one I love, I used to answer that he was Jiafan. But from sometime, the answer changed to "404 Not Found". The value of the variable, updated to NULL.

Yet, snow is always merely snow, feelings are attached by people. In different cultures, symbols are similar. And however the cultures evolve, symbols would hardly change.

Bare trees aside the trail, were poorly covered, and stood in the cold wind with snow. Snow fell. Wind blew. Thoughts flew. I caught everything dissolved in air, and shot the sight in memory. Sky, ground, and horizon, were tinted to white.

My lover is null. My love is blank. My heart is vacant. My anxiety is hollow. My mind is idle. My thoughts is white.
