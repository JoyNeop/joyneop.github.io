Today, I have arrived in Shenyang. In the following two months, I will take a 160-hour English course for the IELTS. After having considered the situation, I finally decided to prepare for the IELTS rather than for the TOEFL.

At 10:00, we four students took a pretest intending to figure out our current abilities, so they would be able to design the entire plan.

The first section was speaking. A lady sat in front of me. She came up with the first question, or to say topic, the brand of my phone.

We then took the listening section, reading section, and writing section. The listening section was a conversation between a student and a clerk in bookstore. They were discussing discount policy for students. The article was about the construction of Snowy Mountain Scheme, a hydro-electric power station in Australia. Finally the writing section asked me to describe a graph exposing the wheat exports of European Community, Australia, and Canada, from 1985 to 1990. I worked poor. Spare my handwriting.

After lunch, we got to the agency which had handled my applications. My mother and I talked with Mr Xing about my destinations, and chose several universities. I asked if it would be ok for me to apply for universities with such high rank, considering I won't provide SAT, and my IELTS score won't surpass 6. He convinced me that they could manage it. And I registered for the IELTS on Dec 14, 2013.

Several years later, today will be considered as my most essential day in 2013, even in my entire lifetime.
