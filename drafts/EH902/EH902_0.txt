Akirauki Hoshino, the young wizard, closed the book in his hand and let the crystal dimmed. Feather covered the pages. He didn't know that exactly would happen to this library. In the last five months, the local government of this small town had closed and occupied the other two libraries, Amamiya's and Tsukisaki's, saying those were for regional security issues. Nobody could tell what it actually meant. Maybe there were harmful spiritual weapons hidden, or some secrets locked? He was then amazed by himself for brave imaginations.

"Good afternoon!" Kouko Kurosaki, his friend, broke the silence with smile, "I can always capture you here when you are not in class. What's up today?"

Akirayuki put the book back to the big wooden desk in front of him, and picked up another, "This library will be closed, sooner or later, I think. Maybe I can find something here as cue, which can tell us the entire story of what happened to Amamiya's and Tsukisaki's."
