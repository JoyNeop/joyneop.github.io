## 0 Moon Eaten

### Emortul survived under an assassin.

Darkness. Brightness. Shadows flew over the ground. Under the moon covered by clouds, secrets stood on their stage. Coldness. Hotness. Unstable winds hovered the roofs. Between the cycle of life and death, blood stroked on the floor.

"Who?!" Emortul was suddenly woken up by the unfortunate provisions in his dream. Hunter's smell flew into his nose. With both eyes and mind searching entire garden, the origin was located at the room of his master, Olivia.

By the time he saw his master lied in blood and moonshine, the assassin was just breaking out through the window. A knife was thrown at his stomach but was then dodged. Without a duration for milliseconds, Emortul launched an Arcane spell which stopped the assassin from breaking out though the window, and the moon shined on the assassin's face softly.

Covered by a mask.

As soon as the effect of the spell expired, he managed to dodge Emortul's following spell which required a long casting time. Instead of killing him, Emortul decided to find out where he would go to know the man who stayed behind.

The full moon in early summer was really bright, and the wind flew around Emortul comfortably. He went invisible with the power of the Void. A professional assassin can always notice any small evidence of being stalked, yet success make him unable to stay calm. Olivia was such strong a wizard, but the traps in the garden was too foolish to defend assassins. Even no magical protection was installed in the room. So he got the notebook with no defense. Unfortunately, he fell in trouble when leaving. Since his boss' command was just to kill Olivia and to get a notebook, instead of also to kill everyone noticed him by the way, there was no need to kill the student. Additionally, the student seemed so strong that fighting with him might consume too much stamina. That was out of his job.

Emortul kept highly concentrated when stalking the assassin, to avoid falling in traps. When sadness and pain came up to his mind, he managed to force them away. Now he only wanted to get truth. To his surprise, the assassin went to governor's hall, then arrived at the police office.

"Your quest item." The assassin put the notebook in front of the man behind the desk.

"Your money." A small bag was picked out from a drawer in the desk, "Easy or hard?"

"Huh," mask was removed, "that's my business."

An old grin was given to the assassin, "Fine. Really glad having hired you."

"Thanks. Bye." The bag contained twenty gold coins. Such money could buy a farm with area of forty-six square kilometers.

Dim candle shadowed the old man's mysterious smile.

"There must be a reason. Why the government need Olivia die?" Reminded Edward, a wealthy friend of Emortul with the same age.

"Maybe for his research. He told me that most scholars who wanted to do research on magic powers may cause killing.

### Documents were maintained by Edward.
### Emortul's home then monitored and locked.
### Emortul started to live in Edward's home secretly.
