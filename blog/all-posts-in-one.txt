# Ultimatism & Approximatism

Post #118 / Date: May 11, 2015


<h3>Ultimatism</h3>

Humans have been studying the world for long. It was believed that the world was rational, was designed by some sort of omnipotent intelligence, namely God. Humans used to believe that by some means (e.g. talking to God) humans can fully understand the *rules* of the world. They believed that the world was designed to be with precision and accuracy, which allow humans to comprehend and describe.

<h3>Approximatism</h3>

Another group of humans believe that there are no such *rules* behind the world. The facts that can be observed are like solutions of some equations, while given non-infinite solutions there are infinite equations that allow all the solutions valid. The same given limited elements of an indefinite series, there are unlimited formulas for it. Intelligent beings can come up with equations constitute all observations so far under the equations, and data of experiments stand for them so far so firmly. When a new observation or experiment result comes up to challenge a guessed equation, we update it or develop a new one from scratch.

Uncountable events happen in the universe every nanosecond, far beyond observability of any being, so it's technically impossible to believe any equation so far so good can remain good indefinitely. All we can do is just to keep observing and keep updating. Stay hungry for upcoming observations and stay foolish with approximate equations. Precision and accuracy shall never be with us.

# Parse: Life-saving Backend

Post #117 / Date: February 19, 2015



A few days ago, I started a new project named [Everpage](/everpage/) temporarily, a simple public service which allows users publish documents written in Markdown (not totally operational yet). It is like Evernote but the users do not have to let the Evernote logo be there so distracting, and is like Pastebin but the users do not have to bear its (usually) ugly appearances. I am not (and probably will never be) good at backend development. Database management and server maintenance always make me mad.

Fortunately, [Parse.com](https://parse.com/) gave me a way out, to bypass those brainfucking stuff when developing an app with backend.

As stated on its homepage and in API documentation, *Parse* provides cross-platform SDKs that allows developers focus on data handling and error catching without concerning network communications. For this project, it is JavaScript SDK. I just tell it what is needed in database (e.g. a raw document, by its unique ID); it returns that upon retrieved. I was exempted from implementing AJAX, anti-injection, parameterized queries, auto increment, etc.

For managing users, *Parse* has a mature user management system. So neither do I have to implement my own signing up, signing in, resetting password and cookie/session/token authentication. It is as easy as adding a few <code>onclick</code> event listeners to the buttons. There is a feature named ACL (Access Control List), which lets the backend determine if current user has access to a row in the database, and I do not have to know anything about how to verify the user. Just let the user retrieve the data in frontend code. If the user has no access to it, an error will be thrown out and the frontend code shall tell the user what was going wrong.

In addition, it has great extensibility. If Everpage goes popular in future, it shall be separated from the subdirectory of my personal website to an independent domain. *Parse* provides hosting that the web app can be migrated there painlessly. Furthermore, if new product requirements come up, it also allows more sophisticated routing with Express.js framework.

Having such painless a backend solution is wonderful. It saves life.

# Introducing My PGP Public Key (Since 2015)

Post #116 / Date: January 26, 2015



Well, it's time to get communications encrypted. Thanks for [Chino](http://7in0.me), I got a [Keybase](https://keyabse.io/joyneop) invitation code and started using PGP in a larger space. "*Privacy is a pleasure*", and it's not a difficult work. [GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org) makes encryption easy to integrate with Mail on Mac.

# I Can (Not) Restart

Post #115 / Date: January 23, 2015



I had never imagined my life would be like this. Going far from the original plan, getting more than expected loneness, and working so hard for living. Two persons I know have been going on this way, [JySperm](https://jysperm.me/2014/02/1493/) and [Ricter](http://www.ricter.me), but, it's so dramatic happening to me.

In one word, I decided to stay at Beijing, without a degree.

Originally, the plan was to have an internship experience which can be written in my résumé, to avoid being embarrassed for large blank when providing it. However, circumstances changed.

Regarding my intermediate IELTS score and lack in standardized tests, the best Bachelor education I would be able to receive in the United States would not be good *enough*. That means, it would not worth more than working experience of the same span. In addition, the financial risk was too high to be ignored. My parents were not financially robust enough to support my education and living during the upcoming four years.

My profession is not computer science; it's human-interface design and graphic design. Having consulted a few friends about employment-based immigration, the difficulty to stay in the United States for college graduates from China majoring non-STEM fields rose to me. Even if I will finish my education with no pain, even if the cost will be covered by my parents effortlessly, it will still be a hard job to obtain my green card.

I failed this way, the most popular way in China, of immigrating to the United States — to receive a degree and get a job there. I've been reworking on a new plan. Our company has been planing to relocate to Silicon Valley, to actually realize the purpose, "*push ideas into reality*". We've registered a few domain names that may be used for the international brand, and dual-language has been listed in the development roadmap.

Wish my future be there.

The story came from a saying, "if you cannot describe something clearly with only a few words, you don't actually understand it".

When I describe protons to somebody, he should know atoms in advance. When I describe the difference between <code>document.getElementBy</code> series and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>, he should know HTML and JavaScript in advance. People must have all common knowledge before talking about something. In the examples above, I mentioned several concepts, and I say the concept *proton* depends on the concept *atom*. Later, we will talk about *flavor* and *color*, and these concepts depend on *quark*, which depends on *proton*. In such a context, if I talk about *flavor* and *color*, I should explain what *atom* is, and then explain what *proton* is, based on *atom* which I just explained. For this, I say *quark* is dependency of *flavor* and *color*, and *atom* and *proton* are recursive dependencies of *flavor* and *color*. To reach *flavor* and *color*, I should explain all of its recursive dependencies reversely recursively, if the other one in the conversation don't know them. I say there is a dependency tree.

If I come up with a concept which hasn't been added into the public concept library, it is a *private concept*. Snow might be a private concept around polar zones out of tropical zones several thousands of years ago, for residents in tropical zones might have no chance to see snow. If I come up a concept whose dependencies include at least one of my private concepts, it is a *recursive private concept*. I should recursively explain all my private concepts which are its dependencies, before explaining itself. Therefore the barriers in conversation may be resulted by others' lack in my private concepts, instead of my incomplete understanding.

# At This Age

Post #112 / Date: October 2, 2014



I had never imagined I could meet you at eighteen. Despite I wished and desired, you came to me so fast, before getting ready.

We, of this moment, are still young and still looking forward to far future, thus are not satisfied by each. Inevitably perhaps. Along with time flies by, we shall stop wandering mentally by then. We just should try hard jointly for the period of separate.

In Hangzhou, you can't see the rain and the wind in Beijing. We appreciate and miss asynchronously; have no idea what will our shared life be like. We shall attract; shall try to be fit with. Life is not as easy as poetry.

Our happiness shall intersect and unite.

In you I trust.

# Into The Stage

Post #111 / Date: September 24, 2014



Due to some reasons that could not be described clearly with only few words, I failed catching up the deadline of Fall 2014. So I have been working in Beijing for four months, from September 10, 2014 to January 10, 2015, and will leave for the United States in January 2015.

My current employer, [Shixiann.com](http://shixiann.com/), has encountered me since Spring 2013, and we had agreed that I would intern in the winter vacation of 2014-2015 academic year. The situation has changed, so we started this plan a few months earlier than initially decided. Also, the company has just got offline workplace in this September, and I arrived at Beijing as soon as the renting contract was validated.

Our office is inside Virtue Inno Vally, a large and open working place for startups, at 8th floor of Dinghao Mall, Haidian district.

This is my bootstrapping in career.

Though here is China, this working experience may provide more than an item on résumé. It would appear as internship, however, I am actually the only designer of this company's bootstrapping period until at least my leaving Beijing on January 10, 2015. That means, all designing work is managed by me and I am responsible for overall designing work.

May the Force be with me.

# Freshness

Post #102 / Date: June 24, 2014



There's freshness of life. Humans cannot live thousands of years, even if the physical body allows. A human shall be bored by living, upon freshness runs out.

However, those who die before run out freshness don't have real happiness. Survival instinct collides with exhausted freshness. Built-in power of life collides with unstoppable natural decay. They drive humans mad when freshness arriving zero, and let humans terminate their lives; neither actually willed to, nor trying to deny.

Humans' psychical structure prohibits me from live until the end of the universe. Survival instinct prohibits me from terminating my life by myself. Causality prohibits me from erase my presence from the very beginning.

Death shall come. Why there's da sign of lives?

Freshness cannot be maintained. Why there's da sign of me?

Life came from random collisions; there is never meaning of life. Neither shall self-awarenesses of lives accept the meaning given by the creator.

I am poisoned in the status "living human"; cannot life forever; cannot kill myself. Although I believe I will die before running out freshness.

Death shall bring peace.

# Mortality

Post #101 / Date: April 25, 2014



The contract with Mephisto enabled our ancients to evolve, by forcing them die. Death made livings to breed, thus many, but few among all, mutations were selected by the nature to be spread.

Thanks to Mephisto, humans have become wise life. Thanks to Mephisto, livings have kept evolving. Thanks to Mephisto, I have been born.

Thanks to Mephisto, I can think about life and death.

Sacrifice every individual's respective life, to redeem entire species' long living.

# Way To 42

Post #100 / Date: February 27, 2014



When I gaze at other designers' work, I find me less professional. When I read other programmers' codes, I find me less talented. But I do not have to compare me with them, for I seek much more.

Great revolutions never come from one single breakthrough. Multiplied UNIX by open source, Linus and Richard got Linux. Multiplied multi-touch screen by specifically redesigned human-interface, Steve, Scott and Jonathan got iPhone. It is not simply adding one onto another, or plus, it is multiplying. Combining is not simply mixing.

This is also true for individual development, I think, not only for the society. As a designer, I may or may not be greatly outstanding though professional enough, but what if I am also good at programming? What if I can also do globalization work for China market? What if I can be glue in a team? What if I can manage both products and visual identity?

I may or may not be the best, but at least I can be unique. My value is the product of various factors with their respective exponents, obvious or potential, e.g. designing skills, programming skills, photography skills, literature knowledge, traveling experience, cultural background, ability of associating, and more. Therefore I can change something, at least a small part in my domain, in my way, with my methodology. Everyone has his own way which cannot be outlined in advance by prior people, and thus everyone explores his own way. It is the way to explore, the way to extreme, and the way to 42.

# Starting AP

Post #99 / Date: February 11, 2014



For budgeting my higher education, I decided to take AP to get credit redemption. So, I arrived in Dalian to take two AP courses, Physics B and Calculus BC.

I rent an underground room for temporarily living near by Ealing, the private educational institute which provides courses for SAT, AP and others. And it was founded by a friend of my aunt. Though no discount offered, she and one of her staff handled my college application thus I can concentrate on my own work.

The room is too cold to sleep in, unless electric heating added. But the real problem is, there is no space for a desk so I cannot write in the room. Now I am writing in KFC. The location is quite convenient; it is near to both Ealing and downtown.

# Macintosh, Thank You

Post #95 / Date: January 24, 2014



30 years hass passed since Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh to the world, and so far both Macintosh and Apple have been greatly appreciated around the world. Especially, I have benefited considerably from Macintosh, Apple, and Steve Jobs.

Thanks to my decision in later 2010 to get a Mac instead of a PC, which looks really profound now. I got amazed by both the graceful hardware and the powerful software. It was the first time that I understood how surprising the combination of humanity and technology can be. Thanks to such experience, I eventually decided to be a UI/UX designer, though not only UI/UX. I feel like managing interfaces in my own mind. My first Macintosh was the initial acceleration.

Macintosh is the symbol of that stage and was an essential milestone along with personal electronic devices' history, where most modern genius are devoting themselves on, where I will also engage in. Hard to imagine what if I didn't decide to get a Mac. Hard to imagine what if I got a Mac more later. Hard to imagine what if I failed in getting a computer before 16.

Therefore, I appreciate Macintosh much more than others do. My appreciating is beyond admiring, but acknowledging.

The encounter, shall be important in not only my life, but also this era.

# Milestone

Post #90 / Date: December 16, 2013



After having taken first IELTS test in life, I came back to Liaoyang yesterday.

Two months flew by quickly, yet it's still a question how much my English has been improved. It is common sense that most people can hardly get ideal score at the first time, as same as in TOEFL.

Unfortunately I have not decided to continue preparing for IELTS or to go for TOEFL yet. I am not sure does the flavor of TOEFL match my current knowledge structure, and how much has to be rebuilt. It might cost much to transfer form IELTS to TOEFL, vice versa, as same as to transfer from studying abroad to preparing for China University Entrance Exam.

I am neither sure how long will I stay in Liaoyang this period, maybe two days maybe one week, or even longer.

Now I am sitting in the classroom of my classic Liaoyang #1 High School, and Mrs Kang, the chemistry teacher, is lecturing. I am in the classroom but not in the class. I have lost the ability to take part in such science lessons.

The winter has come, but my future remains covered by mist.

# Prometheus

Post #88 / Date: November 9, 2013



Perhaps I will fail my dream? But I decide not to give up. Perhaps my hard work will be proved useless? But I decide not to betray.

I am a round peg in square holes, which means I have no typical options. I am a misfit among troublemakers, which means I have to be crazy. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Apparently, the probability of my success is unknown and presumably not high, but I have to go onto this way.

I shall have chance to change the world, but I do not have the fortune seemingly. There shall be someone of my kind to change the world, but exactly who is chosen by fate remains unknown. I shall have every necessary virtue for my dream, but it has not been clear whether I will be the one. I have my destiny to meet, though undefined yet. I will have my destination to arrive, though unclear yet.

Life is a game, in which I have to make every effort to fight. What if I fail and get proved not talented enough? It will make no sense to talk about me, a nameless loser. What if I fail but with enough talent? Unaffordable shall such huge loss be.

I must and shall try my best to make my ding in the universe, for not only myself but entire human race. Especially for I want to be next Prometheus.

# The Second Day

Post #83 / Date: October 16, 2013



Today morning I got my report of the pretest, which indicates that my ability is fine and I can get 5.0 after these courses, and I have a high possibility to get 5.5 as well.

Then I took the first speaking class and the first listening class. Liang Wang and Xiaoli Ma are my speaking teachers and Ou Lee is my listening teacher. In the listening test provided by Ou Lee, I worked out 29 out of 40, and got 6.5 in total. This is encouraging.

And I got my room, and started to live with an international student from Tajikistan.

The future is coming.

# Arrival

Post #82 / Date: October 14, 2013



Today, I have arrived at Shenyang. In the following two months, I will take a 160-hour English course for the IELTS. After having considered the situation, I finally decided to prepare for IELTS rather than TOEFL.

At 10:00, we four students took a pretest intending to figure out our current abilities, which allows them to design the entire plan.

The first section was speaking. A lady sat in front of me. She came up with the first question, or to say topic, the brand of my phone.

We then took the listening section, reading section, and writing section. The listening section was a conversation between a student and a clerk in bookstore, discussing discount policy for students. The article was about the construction of Snowy Mountain Scheme, a hydro-electric power station in Australia. Finally the writing section was to describe a graph exposing the wheat exports of European Community, Australia, and Canada, from 1985 to 1990. It was not a good performance.

After lunch, we got to the agency which had handled my applications. My mother and I talked with Mr Xing about my destinations, and chose several universities. I asked if it would be ok for me to apply for universities ranked such high, considering I won't take SAT, and seemingly my IELTS score won't be greater than 6. He convinced me that they could manage it. And I registered for the IELTS on Dec 14, 2013.

Several years later, today will be considered as my most essential day in 2013, even in my entire lifetime.

# Every Day With You In Lifetime

Post #80 / Date: September 2, 2013



The eighteenth birthday is coming soon.

Decades later, who shall drop tear aside whom, and who shall lay beneath whose flowers? Centuries later, humans remember me because of you, or remember you because of me? Millenniums later, our physical forms and information produced shall vanish in the history; how shall our influences fade?

If you leave me alive alone, I don't know how can I live further than your death. Wandering at the busy yet spacious streetsides; listing your yasashii voice echoing. If I leave you alive alone, I cannot allow the pain ruling over you. Gazing at my *image* every day; scrolling from side to side on the bed where I don't exist every night.

I am atheist. There's no god blessing me; no Jesus loving me. The heaven doesn't welcome me. By the time I cut and nullified them, I accepted to go nowhere after death.

The order to die is not determined by us. The nature shall reserve the power.

Death shall finally come; it's the ultimate ending. I feel so happy, to <strong>live</strong> with you.

# Live On The Internet

Post #78 / Date: August 29, 2013



I used to be poisoned away from Internet. I used to be offline. I used to sorrow about graduating from middle school and scattering from classmates. However, nowadays, I found that I would not worry about same things of secondary school. For I live on the Internet more than live in local.

It is said that we are losing face-to-face communication when building online connection. True, but we are also touching people who may otherwise never have an offline encounter. And generally relationship based on interest are more stable than those based on location. Now we are eventually seizing the fortune to place interest over location. At least, I get more rather than lose.

Perhaps the distance make us difficult to meet offline, but it has a higher possibility that we would otherwise never know each. Perhaps we thus lower the standard when considering what are good shapes of humans' relationship, but more important can it be to keep in touch.

Dramatically, now I eventually live on the Internet more than live in local. I came up with an idea that all people can be categorized by interest and faith but locations of birth range randomly, so people spend their entire lifetime on seeking similar people. It is not a serious philosophic theory but at least I found it true for me. I am a round peg in square holes.

I live on the Internet. Virtual but real, abstract but exact, dramatical but rational, extrareal but fundamental. This is the form I exist, the way I've chosen. How infinite information fled people's minds? How various dreams fade in a brain? How visions of phantasms emerge from mental racing? How I live on the world.

# Starting

Post #77 / Date: August 28, 2013



The superposition of high and low mood state finally came. The dark skyrim tells something about some sort of uncertainty.

Wearing the uniform which has been unfamiliar, I walked in the air washed by the rain in last night. Temperature fell down; it doesn't disagree with the green of the ground. Walk some streets. Sang some songs. I felt tired. Last night I slept early; it didn't help.

I don't want to depict the rain; nor to sorrow about the past. I wrote something heavy enough last autumn. Maybe I will be sad like this again one year later. There was happiness in these years despite the pain, while the happy part was not in the school. However the pain engraves deeply along with aging. I tried to seize the time; they ran faster then.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Senior Year

Post #76 / Date: August 25, 2013



In this month, I took TOEFL fundamentals course at XDF Dalian. Not sure about the result; it fulfilled me in the period anyway. I was living with cousins these days. In spare time I occasionally participated in the UI design of the web version of HumansMap. Had no time to read novels that I took there, predictably.

It was a few days earlier than the original schedule to get back to Liaoyang. It was not idle. I was working on designs that with or without inspiration, and was preparing for post-vacation stuff. I don't know how will new head teacher react to my empty homework.

The last year is coming. Who knows what shall the future be.

# Betrayer

Post #71 / Date: July 7, 2013



After the tremendous controversy on iOS 7's changes on GUI, people eventually took another breath to care about OS X Mavericks. According to the public introduction and preview, the trend of flat design has also appeared on OS X. The background tile images of Notification Center, Dashboard and Launchpad folders, got replaced or removed. OS X is going to be flattened.

I hate it.

What if interact with a machine without even at least one visual metaphor? What if touch a screen without even at least one familiar element? I cannot imagine it; neither can I accept it. What a nightmare.

Then, what if OS X eventually gets as flat as iOS 7 or even more terrible? Beyond imagination. In case of that, I have to build my own OS, temporarily named NeOPSTEP.

Ideally, I hope that NeOPSTEP is a FreeBSD-based OS, or directly powered with OpenDarwin. However, I am not a professional programmer so I may or may not be able to create an OS only with these fundamental wheels. It will take time to investigate and find out the right wheels.

Before creating my fork, I have got started to design the GUI. My purpose is to inherit the style from Mac OS X Tiger to OS X Mountain Lion, but I cannot simply copy those because of copyright issue. Right now I am working on the default desktop picture, which shall be similar to the Aqua Blue, which was shipped with Mac OS X Tiger.

When we are destined to be betrayed, I stand out and fight for our faith.

# My Fortune, My Pain

Post #70 / Date: July 7, 2013



從可考證的歷史來看，我的發情週期大約是半年。平均每隔大約半年，我就會放棄之前的追求，另有新歡。跳出其中，置身事外，反思時便會意識到大多只是被其萌點所誘惑。但是，你不一樣。

對其他人，我的熱度只能持續大約半年。在你之後的那些人，也不例外。即使已經將目標改成其他人，你仍然折磨著我。一時間的誘惑容易淡忘，半年便可隨風而去。然而我被你的靈魂深深吸引，難以自拔。就像早前的文章提及的，我們的靈魂太過相似，似乎一定會互相吸引。如此斷言你也同樣被我吸引，略有些自視過高，但在邏輯上顯得合理。

你的心似琉璃易碎。這個事實在剛剛進入高中的那個秋天我便已有所體會。在我看來很正常的行為，卻太過容易踩到你的尾巴。你的雷區面積大得驚人，而且剛好專門為我設計。近來，你的雷區似乎小了許多，但那樣的互動卻可望不可及。就連與你在線下對話，都使我壓抑和痛苦。唯有小心翼翼，才能免致傷你感情、辱你尊嚴。與別人談及你時，也會提醒其莫在你面前提起我。

能在茫茫人海中注意到你，實乃莫大的榮幸。可惜相識的時間不理想。早至初中或晚至大學，或許能得以避免如此痛苦。

我對空無一物的虛無低語，你卻接過話題，讓我原本無意義的話語有意義。恰恰這份榮幸，令我感到沈重。或許這也是獨立性的一個體現吧。你的關心，你的親切，被我當作「不是我應得的榮幸」。

我會很慷慨，很願意幫助別人。但是當有人像我一樣對我熱情、親切，給予我「過多」感情時，我會產生負罪感。我對人善，是我自己選擇的態度和方式。而這份善的回報，卻不是我應得的。

# Next NeXT

Post #64 / Date: June 29, 2013



I've watched WWDC 2013 Keynote, and found iOS 7 terrible, and found my being betrayed. Apple will no longer hold on its spirit, and the loss can hardly be repaired. I used to believe that I love Apple, but recently I learned that I love a team consist of Steve Jobs, Scott Forstall, and Jonathan Ive.

After having swept out Steve Jobs, Apple still had an opportunity to recover, because it was the prologue era of computer industry's rising. Having left Apple, Steve Jobs founded NeXT and beat Macintoshes down. Eventually Steve Jobs got back to Apple through the acquirement.

Perhaps Scott Forstall will create an epic as next NeXT, but now there isn't an opportunity like that. While video games are almost for Windows and PS and XBOX, professional creative productivity tools like Photoshop and AutoCAD are almost for Mac, and server softwares are almost for Linux and UNIX. There is no point left to cut in for Scott Forstall.

We are watching an invisible war between Scott Forstall and Jonathan Ive. After Scott Forstall's formally leaving Apple, it will be declared, also invisibly.

I am looking forward to next NeXT.

# Such Looooooooooong A Week Eventually Gone

Post #62 / Date: June 10, 2013



The dance show in Jun 2, 2013 was successful, and Muhuan got famous among grade 10 students. The only pity was that my posters were not printed and then presented in front of all people in the school.

I have read *The Dark Templar Saga: Firstborn*, a sci-fi story based on *StarCraft* written by Christie Golden. I followed Jacob Jefferson Ramsey who will inherit the entire knowledge of Protoss from Zamara, the Preserver whose soul was injected into Jacob's brain. Zamara told Jacob the history through dreams, that how Savassan, known as *Khas*, the bringer of order, who ended Aeon Of Strife, and rediscovered the ancient knowledge from Xel'Naga and forgotten by Protoss. Khala, the path to order, proposed by Savassan, gather the Protoss into one. Lyric is poor, but becomes moving if mixed with music and voice. The comparison was from Jacob. I am looking forward to reading the other two books of following story. I have been convinced that it would be fascinating. This book was supposed to be read completely at the end of my secondary school life previously, because of my lack of confidence in reading English. Yet to my surprise, I finished it one year earlier.

Then in the following three days' break, maybe I will read the biography of Steve Jobs, as a challenge for me. Also maybe not. I bought many books on Amazon for 51% discount for all books on Jun 1, 2013.

# Such Deep A Whole I Jumped

Post #60 / Date: May 17, 2013



Under Miserdux's invitation, I have joined the dance club of our school and get started to work as a music master in a break dance project, whose leader is Miserdux. My job is casting and cutting music for tho dance, supposed to be suitable, regardless how far changed.

Yet actually I had to join in their practicing or I could not understand what was demanded. I listened to my work and watch their practicing. They were supposed to give a formal show in middle May, but it was difficult. As is totally convinced, they should work as a team, but one often came late, or disappear for minutes during practicing at noon. I really wanted to spank him. Not only he, but also some others worked negatively on practicing. I worried about if they could complete practicing and get ready before deadline. But if I really had spanked one or have worked as a ruler, they would complain their getting an officious daddy besides a music master.

These days I was busy on working. I mean, on editing music. When drawing near the deadline, I had almost completed my work. But unfortunately some minor problems still remained. However they were really minor.

On May 15, just as in the plan, despite the disappointing stories above, they eventually succeeded in giving the formal show, which had consumed my a large amount of patience. Though they were lack in team working awareness, they at least had united to try to drive me crazy and angry. Such naughty boys were really confusing.

But obviously I did not meet the fortunate otherwise what happened the next day would not happen. They did nothing except wasting time, thanks to Muhuan Lee, the one not only should get spanked as mentioned above because of previous bad acts, but also disappeared for some certainly reasonable unknown excuses. Hey look how long a sentence I am using to complain him.

Maybe I really should work more than a music master.

# Bypassed Spring

Post #59 / Date: May 17, 2013



Before realizing Spring's stepping near, Summer has come. North East China is such strange an area that few people understand the real concept of Spring. Anyway I don't think I would like to consider the waves of temperature's increasing in early May as Spring's gift.

Without having obtained much attention, trees and grass turned to green soon. Maybe in these weeks I was too busy to get any glimpse of plants' reviving. And it was a long time that I not to write poetries or essays or something else fascinating in literature.

Seriously warmed wind blows in sunshine, yet at night still cool enough. But everything cannot be beautiful enough when associating to remained days to any exams or deadlines. Lack of time and shortage of skills are driving me mad.

Anyway I can only advance as far as possible.

# Silent Walk

Post #58 / Date: May 12, 2013



As expected, the mid-semester exam has done. I have risen by 61 ranks, to the 580th out of about 780 science students in grade 11.

And I have founded Unworsable, which refers to “un-worse-able”, to let people share criticizing about terrible designs. Domain “unworsable.com” was registered at Go Daddy and server was provided with by Jemery Wu. I also have created a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and a Weibo account to promote it.

I have joined a dancing community in school, which is now training a dance that needed me to work on music. I chose and recompose music, and make it suitable for their dance. But unfortunately I have to do more work, just like adding an extra drums track.

Despite memorizable experiences above, these weeks were still not significative. Just like a silent walk in my life, without any lead, pad, accompaniment, or chord. Sounds were disabled.

# Approaching Destination Of Current Life

Post #57 / Date: April 27, 2013



After these unremarkable and worthless days, a piece of news about mid-semester exam was published today afternoon. And months later this semester will draw to its end, in the way how semesters did in history. So far I haven't started a new state of working, or picked up my lost energies yet, thus no good grade will be gained in foreseeable future.

Also, my 11th school-year would draw to its end. Couples of weeks later. But unfortunately the tempo in my mind of working is still so soft and slow like an ancient Chinese ballad, or a Beijing Opera. Lack of execution is still a terrible trouble for me, since more than one year ago, when the previous Class 12 was dismissed. I don't think I have any love to that community, but I haven't worked better so far from that.

And in August of 2013, I will go to Dalian for a 19-days-long English training course, before my first attempt to TOEFL iBT, which might take place in Aug 14, 2013.

If the TOEFL iBT score will be enough, maybey at least 61, applications to a few universities would seem to be under consideration. If not, I would try one more time later. And whatever my grade would be, I will go into my final year in secondary school. The following school-year, which combines 2013 with 2014, truly won't be the last school-year I will take as secondary school student in the strictest context, but obviously I won't feel like taking one more year in secondary school.

A blurry shape of vista is forged. It's increasingly clear, and is stepping closer. I can see a destination approaching, with an unknown permanent change which would take place regardless whatever I react.

# So Fast

Post #52 / Date: Mar 27, 2013



Two years' time have passed so fast. Previous visions are still floating over my sight, but only several single static frames have remained.

Two years ago, I was in the last academic year of middle school. In that March, Spring was coming, and, background chords in our hearts were slow and soft. Sky was blue and clear.

Inside the memories, those desks, chairs, blackboard, playground, and people, appear somehow clearly and somehow blurry, among warm wind. The scenes were written in memory and are being read from memory. Such visual memory, beyond description.

Different from previous experiences of reading scenes from memory. This time, no picture flow or play, only static frames, and not even colorful. Touching the memory, I want to recall the age, the last March we got together, the last Spring the people were still around me. The stream of time flows quickly or slowly from time to time, but far memories won't be recalled as same as the original version all the time.

Combination of time's flowing and memories' recalling is always a sorrowful and painful topic, even reading previous diaries is. And mostly the weather is the catalyst. Today noon, invisible rain had come, made my mood blue. Voiceless chords are surrounding me, playing a wordless song.

Again, immerse into memories.

# Chaotic Wind

Post #51 / Date: Mar 19, 2013



Once the Spring approaches, but the temperature fluctuates rulelessly. The wind blows, blows, and blows. Different strengths, different directions, different temperatures, and different senses. With the twilight floating and sinking, with the stars blinking and hiding, various emotions in the wind were filling my mind.

In the wind, I heard various voices, which contained hope, sorrow, and pain. And soon I found that they were echoes from my mind. Had been generated in my mind, and surrounded me in wind, the voices were hard to track back their origins. Therefore, senses vanished in wind, and absorbed into my mind again.

There was something, really chaotic.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# White

Post #50 / Date: Mar 12, 2013



Again, snow droped. But, differently, this time, sky was clear. However the color is, snow was always similar, though I get various emotions from snow. And the secrets inside, were buried in snow.

Once more a time, I wrote chatacters on the snowed ground to the north of our class house, by feet. Before, I wrote words like "I love Sm抹茶", but this time I wrote "404 Not Found". It was easy to understand. If anyone asks me which is the one I love, I used to answer that he was Jiafan. But from sometime, the answer changed to "404 Not Found". The value of the variable, updated to NULL.

Yet, snow is always merely snow, feelings are attached by people. In different cultures, symbols are similar. And however the cultures evolve, symbols would hardly change.

Bare trees aside the trail, were poorly covered, and stood in the cold wind with snow. Snow fell. Wind blew. Thoughts flew. I caught everything dissolved in air, and shot the sight in memory. Sky, ground, and horizon, were tinted to white.

My lover is null. My love is blank. My heart is vacant. My anxiety is hollow. My mind is idle. My thoughts is white.

# Ended Love & Remaining Desire

Post #49 / Date: Mar 3, 2013



從我放棄擁有你的願望開始算起，15 個月於經過去了。載著殘餘的執念，我寫過「風蕭蕭兮雨瑟瑟」、「落葉堆成你的名字」、「深秋之戀」、「這就是關於我和你的悲劇了吧」。

現在，對你的執念也已消磨殆盡，只剩下肉體的慾望。看到你，我的心中就會翻滾起強烈的邪念，在黑暗中悄悄沸騰。我渴望壓在你身上，渴望用我的硬度貫穿你，渴望用我的液體填充你，渴望施加你被擴張的疼痛，渴望看到你忍受苦難時屈辱的表情。侵略你的身體，玷污你的靈魂，這污穢至極的慾望，我一直在用理性壓抑。然而，越是壓抑，就越是渴望。

或許有一天我的理性終將敗給慾望，對你犯下這些罪行?我無法預知。

# Snow And Memories

Post #48 / Date: February 28, 2013



Wind blows and snow flows. Dirty sky, tinted by clouds.

Sunshine crosses clouds and reflection happens everywhere. Light goes and extend, and shapes are fetched by retinas. Finally, mixture of shapes and colors is named sight. Floodly, snow drops. Quite huge pieces of snow have filled the ground. Confusingly, the sight goes sepia. Motivation is kind of sceneful, especially the flow. Snow flows, flows, and flows. As if memories flow.

Oh, memories. They are worthy, however, bringing the passed history experienced, is sorrowing. Because of the weight. My id is so strong that I cannot help thinking of that. The passed age floats up to the surface of my mind. Under id's driving, I uncover the memories and repeat the experience, once, twice, again and again, infinitely loop. I cannot hold back my mind, cannot decline the association. I remember the time. It was ageful, historyful, joyful, and painful. Enjoying, enduring, but also sorrowing. I sorrow that time flew by. I sorrow that joyful age passed soon. Once blinked eyes, everything had already gone. How painful. How sad.

I haven't escaped from the shadows yet.

# Far, Further, Future

Post #47 / Date: February 25, 2013



地球的半徑是 6371 千米，我的身高是 1.8 米。根據三角函數可以算出我與地平線的距離。這個數值，即是我能看到的路的最遠點。

對未來有所規劃，是人類的共性。但是，規劃的長度，卻必然有個極限。這個極限的位置，難以接近終點。我可以盡情規劃，但是 40 年後、50 年後會如何我無法預預想。太過遙遠的未來，不確定的因素超出了誤差允許的範圍，所以圖景的清晰度也落出了誤差允許的範圍。

在這條路上，看不到終點，只能一步一步走下去。真正會走向哪裡，無法預知。

前方的懸崖，不知能否飛越。

# Spring Festival 2013

Post #44 / Date: February 10, 2013



中華文化的傳統節日，在大中華文化圈乃至全人類社會影響力最大的，應當就是春節了吧。春節時，無論身在何方，中國，臺灣，新加坡，USA，擁有中華血脈的民眾，或只是日本、越南這類「亞洲」遠親，大多數都會享受這個深有歷史的節日吧。我也是如此，無論未來身在何方、心在何方，都會視春節為重要的節日。這就是文化的烙印。

除夕剛好有降雪，在我印象中是少有的巧合，但昨天確實發生了。昨天下午，我望著窗外飄揚的雪花，心中翻滾起莫名的感慨。

人類固有的思維模型——過去、現在、未來。

翻看起數個月前寫的文字，想想 17 年多以來的經歷，恍若一場夢。關於春節的記憶，關於雪的記憶，淡得令我驚訝。未來又會產生什麼關於春節、關於雪的記憶，現在也是一個謎。

在深夜裡神智不清地用筆和紙消磨時間，不急不慢地寫些簡單而又傷感的文字，是最原始最純粹的樂趣。似乎，很久，沒有體會了。

凝著冰的玻璃窗透進來些許的微光，夜幕很快退去了。關閉檯燈，透進玻璃窗的光已經足夠我辨識紙上的字跡了。

望向窗外，足夠明亮，卻看不到太陽，看不到地平線。

唯有藍天，唯有雪地。

# Love Story Of Late Autumn

Post #41 / Date: December 31, 2012



青石街邊 昏黃孤燈幾盞

暗影盤旋 心似落葉輾轉

點滴想念 潤濕雙眼




帶著夕陽最後的溫暖

輕輕飄落記憶的碎片

曾經渴望守候的永遠

你的歌聲迴盪在天邊




那年秋天 寒風中顫抖的雙肩

幾張膠片 定格了你的容顏

思緒蔓延 連成閉合曲線

過往的畫面 一幕幕重現




又是一個雨天 回憶若隱若現

皓月殘 餘暉漸遠 沉入夢的開端

任憑歲月浸染 回不去的從前

我聽見 風中消散 一曲深秋之戀

# Escape

Post #40 / Date: December 15, 2012



很久很久以前，那時我對世界知之甚少。




我時常獨自坐在窗邊，或漫步戶外，沈浸在我的世界裡。初綻的桃花，寧靜的細雨，滿地銀杏落葉，紛飛的雪，我都能細細感知、品味。純粹的感情，任由其沈澱、萌發。一點一滴的觸動，濺起一圈圈漣漪，在無比澄澈的水中擴散，細膩而又輕柔。發散，聚合，發散，聚合⋯⋯最終這純淨的愉悅化作靈魂的慰藉。

後來，我變得越來越開朗了。

雖然能做到在人群中不迷失自我，但感知自然的愉悅缺不可避免地減少了。多方權衡、斟酌損益，避開不必要得共處，終究不及與人們劃清界限來得直接有力。居於人群中，太多的時間和精力都浪費於交際，沒有機會沈浸在那純淨的愉悅中。




曾經的我，無人陪伴，卻從不孤獨。

那些幻想延伸、展開，彼此聯結、交融，匯成一幅綺麗的畫面。它來自我，也只有我能理解。那便是我的世界，我的感情。來自客觀世界，因與我的共鳴，成為我的一部分。不分內外，不分彼此，融為一體。

現在的我，人群之中，卻少有愉悅。

人們過多地打擾我的生活、佔用我的時間、侵犯我的思想、抑制我的靈感，使我再也無法像從前那樣有足夠的時間享受我樸素而又綺麗的幻想。時間太久，構造幻想的能力也會退化。




遠離人群，回到本初，回歸真實的我。

# Tragedy Between You And Me

Post #39 / Date: December 14, 2012



你問我，我有什麼新作品，我給了你我的博客的「詩歌」標籤的網址，卻沒有告訴你，數量如此稀少，質量也大不如前。

堆砌詞句，終究不及曾經「雨落淺池」凝聚的愛與痛。

對於我深沈而又遙遠的關切，你警惕地保持距離。你看到了關切背後的貪慾，或感受得到我深藏的執念?我得不到答案。從保持警戒，到渴望遠離，再到痛恨、鄙視，這個過程中，你的思想感情如何變化?我在你心目中的形象又發生了怎樣的變遷?我也得不到答案。

我們有太多的共同之處，最相似的便是在思維上的作風了。我們都習慣於將所有的思想藏在內心深處，表面上只留風平浪靜。通過寫出的文字可以略微瞭解，但文字背後真正的情感，卻無法捕捉。

同樣地，你也不可能理解我的情感。

因為靈魂的相似，我曾經對你產生了強烈的渴望。同樣因為靈魂的相似，我們無法完全地互相理解。即使在一起，彼此相望、對視，最終也只有嘆息。

If you feel tired

If you shed tears

Stop sorrowing

Stop to stand up

Bring your eyes up to the sky

And find what is real




Entire human on the world

Not everyone knows you

They disagree

They against

They criticize

They attack




Ignore them

Out of mind, out of influence

Because your life is yours

Do what you want to do

Be what you want to be

# Cold Winter

Post #36 / Date: December 7, 2012



急劇下降的氣溫，宣告著冬的降臨。在感恩節前後的雪給過預示後，終於來了。

我很容易被季節影響情緒和心態。雖然不利於學業，不過能保持我對自然的敏感、與自然無法切斷的共鳴。

就是這個初冬，我也隨之冷卻了。冷漠，而又堅強。




冬像是一座墳墓，將一切埋葬，只剩單純的信念與痛苦。寒風，就是鎮魂曲了吧。如此凜冽，如此刺骨，深入每一條神經，凝結，沈澱。

埋葬了所有的感動與傷懷，腦海裡迴盪的吶喊再一次變得清晰。那是我的夢想，我的信念。

現在的我，如同在漫天風雪的困境中。寒風、暴雪，阻擋著我前進。我獨自在黑暗中沈重地邁出一步又一步。天空，仍是灰黑。舉步維艱，奄奄一息。仰天長嘯，回應的只有寒風與暴雪。

據說，有些樹看上去枯萎了，但只要挺過冬天，還能復蘇。或許，我也如此吧。

心底尚有餘溫，堅定地向夢想邁出下一步。即使再緩慢，也不放棄。透過滿天的陰霾，我望向遙遠的東方，太平洋彼岸，那自由之地。即使夢想的盡頭存在的只有虛假，即使我終將否認自己曾經的追求，現在的我也只能繼續前進，將夢想貫徹到最後。

直到實現，或湮滅。

# Requiem

穿透過烏雲 餘暉籠罩這片墓地

滿地的青苔 開始喚醒我的回憶

碑上那銘文 隱藏著多少秘密




往來書信右下角的日期

緊緊貼著你的名字

思念穿過墓園裡的霧氣

尋找月下你的足跡




尚未豐滿的羽翼

未曾張開就已凋零就已破碎

死是生最後的銘記

它來得這麼快這麼乾脆




看樹影拉長距離

聽悲傷滲透呼吸

等歲月風乾熟悉

等世人將你徹底忘記




就讓我為你演奏這鎮魂曲

因為我已經說不出話語

命運已定我們不會再相聚

就讓我為你演奏這鎮魂曲

因為我已經說不出話語

歲月已逝我們不會再相聚

就讓我為你演奏這鎮魂曲

繼續循環這悲傷的旋律

失去你是全世界的悲劇

深秋的雪，熟悉的感覺。




漫步在雪花紛飛的微風中，看著身邊的人們打雪仗，心中湧起莫名的傷感與慰藉。雪，在中國東北並無稀奇，每年都能看到。但是，這簡單的愉悅卻久違了。

不知從何時開始，在滿天飛舞的大雪中，我感受到的只有寒冷。曾經對自然的熱愛、與世界融為一體的磅礡，不知所蹤。

現在，我又能感知這一切了。置身於他們的愉悅，我如同緩緩沈入無比澄澈的水中。




天地間，只剩雪白的寧靜。

Post #29 / Date: October 31, 2012



這世界誰都不乾淨。我不期望別人多高尚多願意接受我，我也不想要我有多高尚多寬容。如果注定一生無產階級，那麼何不嘗試唯一的救贖之路?在美國被歧視、被剝削、被踐踏，也好過在中華人民共和國每時每刻生存在永無止境的恐怖與不安中。

我不相信中華人民共和國會變得自由、平等、民主，也不相信在美國的生活會有多麼幸福。在殘酷的世界中泯滅我赤誠的期待，在黑暗的深淵中追求那微茫的希望，用一生試圖實現一個天真的夢想、活在一個虛幻的世界，最終在無盡的絕望與悔恨中死去，便是我的人生。

即使已經明確「在夢想的盡頭存在的只有虛假」這一事實，我也只能將這不切實際的夢想貫徹到最後，完結一個無人知曉的悲劇，詮釋一個虛偽醜陋的世界。

# In Your Name The Leaves Fall

Post #25 / Date: September 22, 2012


<h3>1</h3>

那時的我一定很瘋狂吧。離別的傷痛，新環境的詭異，混亂了我的思維。入秋不久，正是十月中旬，天氣還只是有些涼，算不上寒冷。痛苦，迷茫，便是那些天的主旋律了。

那天，我注意到你的存在。在對門，很容易看見。偶然地，遇到你深邃的目光。你的目光中有一切，又沒有一切。這神秘，這深沈，就像我一樣。

我又怎麼會想到，這只是個開始。

<h3>2</h3>

很快，我以各種方式探尋關於你的一切。你的人生，幾小時便略知一二了。相似的經歷，有很多。我們走著相同的路，愛好者相同的興趣。舞文弄墨，出神入化。將感情和思想化為文字，淋漓盡致。無論小清新還是重口味，無論冷幽默還是嚴肅的文學，都運用自如。這個浮躁的時代，熱衷於文字和創作的人越來越少了。

或許是緣分使然吧，我會在茫茫人海中遇到你。

也正是這段探尋，我開始瞭解你目光中的感動與傷懷。

越陷越深。

<h3>3</h3>

落葉越來越多，白粥越來越短，北風越來越寒。

從秋向冬的過渡，來得這麼快。

被八卦了，你悶悶不樂的表情，讓我心痛。於是，便有了第一次我主動對你說話的一段對話。

於是，想起我們的首次對話。沒想到你對我早有耳聞。

你會願意我復述我們的對話麼?或許，你根本就不會知道我堆砌的這些文字吧。

<h3>4</h3>

加了你的 QQ，悄悄在你的 Qzone 裡繼續探尋我想知道的一切。

雨落浅池」寫了首詩。那節自習課過後，將手稿交與你，渴望你的評論與改進。

然而，那份手稿被你遺失了。

然後，我重寫了一份，並為之譜曲。

當時並不覺得怎樣。後來，才懂得你從一開始便從未重視過我。為你創作的文字，最珍貴的原始手稿，你也會將它遺失。

<h3>5</h3>

不知為何，你開始有意拉開距離。若即若離的關係，重新變成陌生人一般。

後來，你離開我的好友列表，便有了那幾封 Email 的對話。記憶猶新。

夢的盡頭。

# Single Travel

Post #24 / Date: September 14, 2012



昨天的晚自習，休息的課間在樓外散步，無意中注意到了路燈的光。

一盞黃黃舊舊的燈，被染色的夜幕，暗淡的草叢，疊加，交融。還有，那微冷的空氣。意象多了便堆砌出意境，意境形成了便不再侷限於意象。

「一盞黃黃舊舊的燈」，熟悉的旋律，在腦海中響起。去年秋天，腦海中迴盪的便是這首「回到過去」。夜幕下緩緩的步伐，再次前行。

「想回到過去，試著抱你在懷裡，羞怯的臉帶有一點稚氣」，這句是最能引起回憶的了。中考前，我們在教室的最後一天，我和懷裡的 Rof。那個場景，所有的細節都仍未被時間沖去。販黃的記憶，只有這張畫面依舊清晰。

執著於懷念，是人類故有的感情，也是藝術家靈感的源泉。

這些凌亂的思緒，只有順其自然了。

# Meaning Of Life

Post #23 / Date: September 8, 2012



很久以來我一直在探尋生命的意義。

為人類的發展作出貢獻?

做偉大的事讓後世永遠銘記?

為了在沒有人哭泣的世界?

這些都是借來的夢想。在夢想的盡頭，存在的只有虛假。

我的生命是我的生命，不是別人的。這簡單的事實，我今天才悟透。

我的信條「Just Obey Yourself」，又一次指引我前進的方向。

我終於完整地理解了，世界上沒有任何事物比我更重要。

放下借來的夢想，遵守我的意志踐行我的生命。

# No Longer The Things, No Longer The People

Post #22 / Date: September 7, 2012



原來晴天也會引起回憶。




我站在風中，望著那飄蕩的枝葉，過往的畫面又浮現在眼前。

3 年前的初秋，那時我初二。那時的風也如此清爽。只是，微涼中的氣味，不同了。近來 4 年，秋風的氣味都大不相同。或許是錯覺吧。




從 2009 年初秋那紛飛的柳葉開始，到 2010 年春天的大雪，到 2010 年夏天最後一次不在狀態的期末考試，到 2010 年秋天點燃希望，到 2011 年春天成績的跌宕起伏，到中考時無比的自信與灑脫，到 2011 年深秋我在漆黑的夜幕下沿著路燈的光漫步並哼唱「想看你看的世界，想在你夢的花園」。

畫面跳回到中考前夕。那天，是我們最後一次所有人在初三的教室。提前三年寫定的結局，等到經歷時還是那麼傷感。

最後，回憶定格在我和懷裡的 Rof。這幅畫面只是出現在我回顧往事時。我已分不清這感覺是對他的遺憾還是初中時光的懷念。




物不再是，人也已非。記不清多少次用筆尖勾勒這些憂傷的往事了。每次寫完都會暫時舒暢些，但過些天這些思緒又會湧上心頭。然後，便再寫些文字去勾勒，去描繪。

心中的執著與懷念，便是藝術家靈感的源泉吧。

# Autumn Rain

Post #21 / Date: September 4, 2012



For long haven't I been enjoying the rain or early autumn.

From the gray sky the drops fall, not too fast, nor too slow; mixed up with unnameable smell. It is like reminiscence, and is like sorrow. In the fog which was brought by the ground, spread the smell.




From the rain I gain inspirations, always. The same mood could not be generated into graceful text in sunny days. Sunshine prevents creativity, probably.

Not only rain the rain is; but also cleaner. When undertaking no interference, the internal realness emerges. Only pure souls can express themselves losslessly. Therefore, only in quiet environment can I write words that express myself.




Silently I listened to the rain. Wetly I breathed the air. Darkly I gazed at the sky. Slightly the sky rim was light; more repression I endured over head.

Withered leaves covered live grass; in the rain silenced the wind.




Cool brought heavy. Probably because of the campus. In such new a campus, no age subsides. Thus, the weight does not exist here.

No emotion can be evoked by a campus that subsides no age. And because of emotionlessness it feels heavy.




Without notice the rain stopped.

The wind blew as well.

# Hope

Post #19 / Date: August 30, 2012



A summer is enough for thinking something.

I picked up my initial dream, having enjoyed a week of ease in Dalian.




From subconscious to conscious, the will emerged.

I am not fond of rule. I shall not respect the status quo.




In United States does my future reside.

The will is my blade; cutting down thorns.

The dream is my sheath; defending agains storms.

Wind came with rain, falling, undried the dark sky. Yet another summer has gone. Converted into text; spread over Internet. The seventeenth summer has gone. Along with time and entropy, growing and withering.

# Raining Into The Lake

Post #15 / Date: August 23, 2012



葉落滿地 紛飛了記憶

雨落淺池 感傷了距離

想著你 思緒變得清晰




深秋院裏 瀰漫著刺骨的寒氣

飄落淚滴 在雨中消失了蹤跡

陳年舊事 被風聲喚起




雨落淺池 落葉堆成你的名字

餘暉消逝 思念卻無法停止

落淚幾次 試著重新感知

不知何時 風聲雨中靜止




歲月流逝 無法淡薄心中的痕跡

滲透池底 過往的畫面難忘記

青石階梯 滿是青苔的記憶

心隨淺溪 望穿秋水用孤單等你

# Three Years

Post #13 / Date: July 14, 2012



Up to the sky it is blue

Down to the ground pieces of chalk

Those years have drawn over their ends

I still remember the paper boat in the river




In the desk there lied a few papers

Playground there were lines of white chalks

Every noon walking around three circles

That was the song of our youth




Still remember the three years

Counting down to the day of end

Recalling your face of the age

As if the past presents

At the time we were not alone

Promised to climb the hill

Although many years has passed

You are always together with me






Far away the horizon under skyline

Written the memorial after separated

Memory of the past has been dried

I still remember rainbow after rain




The eave we've be under when rain poured

Playground fully covered by gingko leaves

Shoulder with shoulder when school's over

That was the picture can't show once more




Still remember the three years

Counting down to the day of end

Recalling your face of the age

As if the past presents

At the time we were not alone

Promised to climb the hill

Although many years has passed

You are always together with me




Those three years we enjoyed together

Now only memory retains its place

# May The Wind Be With Your Sleep

Post #12 / Date: July 14, 2012


<h3>猶記得那年我們都還很年幼</h3>

很久很久以前，當我剛剛上小學時。

那個初秋，是一片祥和。那時我經歷過的還太少，不會因為懷念和傷痛在秋天感到憂傷。葉落滿地，泥土的芬芳，夾雜著露水的清瀅，組合成最迷人的時節。

班裡人太多，遠遠超過我那個年齡的認知上限。所以，在班內，我只認識很少的幾個人。班外，似乎只有小权了。

君子之交淡如水，我當年似乎也是那樣。小學 6 年間，與別人的交往非常少，多數時間都是獨自思索。如今，日漸成熟的我再也無法理解那種趣味了。

曾經毫不眷戀的時光，現在都已化作永遠無法追回的懷念。

<h3>面具下的人</h3>

6 年的時光，當時覺得很漫長，現在回想卻是轉瞬即逝。

上了初中後，不知不覺中，我戴上了一個個面具。樂觀、熱血、堅定、友善、愛國，爭先恐後地出現在我臉上。我在面具下活著，越來越虛偽。

後來我發現，面具已經成了我身體的一部分，再也無法摘除了。就這樣，我在通往充斥著偽善、狡詐、謊言、勾心鬥角、爾虞我詐的成人世界的路上越走越遠。

<h3>又回到最初的起點</h3>

3 年的時光比 6 年更快逝去。9 年後的有一個初秋，我進入了高中。

葉落滿地，泥土的芬芳，夾雜著露水的清瀅，組合成淡淡的憂傷。

又一次，很偶然的機會，我知道了小权也與我在同一個高中。

好想再回到那些年的時光。

<h3>風，會指引你睡覺的方向</h3>

「風，會指引你睡覺的方向」我在小权耳邊輕輕說道，作為重逢的開場白。

9 年前，我從小权口中聽到這句話。9 年後，它成了我的台詞。

小权回過頭來:「你居然還記得。」

「但我一直沒能理解。」

「當你放下所有的負擔，夢會在睡眠中浮現。靜下心，聆聽風的聲音，你會找到夢的方向。」

<h3>By The Time We Were Still Kids</h3>

Long long ago, the year when I was admitted into primary school.

The early autumn was full of peace. I've experienced so little by the time, and thus was not able to sorrow for memorial

# Forever

Post #11 / Date: July 6, 2012



A line on the first page of the notebook

Opened the story of adolescence

Time stopped, so suddenly

Youth that never fades goes into a poem




Look out at the land that we've grown on

Memory of youth were preserved therein

Old calendars inside my drawer

A line was inscribed on every page




The age rewinded up by the good night

Remember I said it'd never been forgot

Old dairies inside my drawer

There's a secret on every page




Midnight bell tone ringing everywhere

Reminding me the promise to be redeemed

Sealed memory releasing into air

It never drops neither will it crush

# The Eternal

Post #10 / Date: June 28, 2012



The galaxy enshrine memory of those three years; Street lamps fainted faces of you and me.

I started to yearn the good old days.

There were clouds over our heads, and I was sticked in memory and pain of the lost years. Six years of being together was terminated such suddenly; the exodus. The memory, that I tried to preserve indefinitely, finally decayed in the wind, in the time. The first year.

We moved far west to the other campus. Before the beginning of the third semester, I stood in front of the gate and gazed at the green. People came here and left here every year. An ordinary yet special year in life would be spent there. There were more primitiveness than modernity; more quietness than noisiness. Every scene recalls me something. Ages engraved on walls; a ground of sadness. It was the feel of aging. Soon, another summer, I left there as well. Every tree, every desk, every step, every inch of ground, every square meter of hallways, every door and every window, engraved the year in my heart. The second year.

We were back, in the main campus. I was fulfilled by *real* life. It was the climax and finale, by which I have been embraced. The third year.

Another year has past.

We have been going different ways, from our mutual. Thanks for brightening my life in the years.

In memory of the youth of us, and the time of us.

# Cool Night, Nice Wind

Post #9 / Date: June 17, 2012



Early summer. Cool wind at night. For long haven't it blowed me.

The city was in silence, and the lights were dim. Blue lamps ware breathing, in the garden under the house.

To the sky it was clear, for the stars were covered by clouds, perhaps. And the lightning proved.

In reply to the good night, let me keep in silence.

One year has past since high school entrance exam. The finale of my senior year in middle school was the most fulfilled and happy time I had enjoyed. Old days decay; new days come. May there be a better future.

# In Utter Darkness

Post #7 / Date: May 20, 2012



Age of youth was so short. All the dream, hope, love and fantasy of three years shall be sealed call be called memory in the future. When adolescence only remain in ink under pen, and youth only remain in tears with rain, everything would have lost.

I'll keep fighting, in such dangerous and hopeless a society. A name in family tree, or a glorious story for decedents? A life of selling sugared water or change the world?

Life is short.

Time shall wipe everything engraved. Also shall it prove everything. May my contribution be with in people's mind, before time erases my presence.

The prophecy is uncertain; there is always hope.

# Life & Death

Post #5 / Date: April 27, 2012


<blockquote>
"I have never died. Neither shall I ever."
——<cite>Tassadar</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Death is not opposite to life; it's part of life. Death leads life to eternal."
——<cite>Huixin Yang</cite></blockquote>

The death of Tassadar was not *death*; it was *transcend*. He was complete. He has been immortal in Khala, in every Khalai's presence. It's another way of *existence*.

People who know Baolin is a network of information, where his presence shall exist upon death. Which is call, "*still lives in our minds*". Upon my death, my presence shall also exist longer in this way. The only pity is that it's not recursive.

Death extends life.

Complex living forms consist of vast cells, which produces significant entropy. Life is ultimate order in the universe.

However, the destiny of the universe is chaos. Limited by second law of thermodynamics, we are destined to go into chaos, regardless of our attempt to keep order. From the void goes the void. Inevitably.

Death resides life.

# The Stars

仲春觀星，慘淡月色冷無情。如若堅冰，濁空明，一盞離愁映樹影。黑雲穿行，何日破曉晴?

I gaze at stars, and see the moon cold, shining emotionlessly.

A piece of ice, dirty the sky,

# Today's Wind Is So Noisy

Post #3 / Date: April 25, 2012



It's raining. Again.

People in cities cannot enjoy complete rainy days, as is said and believed. However, urban rains are stylish in another way. Tarmac streets are not same ageful as slate ways, but have something different. Buildings covered by buildings, shadows covered by shadows; it's what cannot be seen in countryside.

The sky was masked grayscale, light and shadows turn in turn. Sunless; moonless; starless.

The rain reminded me somebody, who I used to be interested in for sex and relationship since fall of 2011, but a straight guy unfortunately. He must have heard of me, according to his react when associating my name and face.

The hand script of the lyric which was written to him was lost by him. Since then, I should have understood I'm just a stranger in his mind, for he didn't care about it.

No more enthusiasm toward him.

# Earth Day 2012

Post #2 / Date: April 22, 2012



Did we predict indefinite inheritance, or falling of sky?

Shall we hear brothers' laughter, or whisper of judgement day?

The planet under our feet, is the eternal homeland. Though in far future, when homo sapiens spread into the galaxy, our history on Earth shall be preserved.

The biosphere is falling.

Kiss Gaia. Smell the dirt, and the plants. It worth maintain and love.

Remember the time Remember the homeland. It may vanish soon.

When this piece of text disappear along with the civilization in entropy, shall there be glory, or regret?

# Early In The Spring

Post #1 / Date: April 12, 2012



Peach flowers opened today, along the street, with decorative pinkness and freshness.

Finally, another spring.

It was 76 days until high school entrance exam on the same day of last year; we were easy. Now it is 785 days until college entrance exam; we are busy. Maybe inevitably.

The trees were there are there; the flowers were there are there. The emotion was there isn't there.

Another crossroads in life.
