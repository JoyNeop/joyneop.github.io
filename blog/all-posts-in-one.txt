# The Story Behind RandomFont

Post #122 / Date: Jul 7, 2016



Last year, I published a small [special page](https://joyneop.xyz/types/) on my website, in which a few my favorite fonts were displayed each with a specimen picture. However, this was not scalable, and was limited as an extension of my personality.

Then I have been thinking how could I make it more useful, and competitive among all products of typography theme, especially those developed by foundries and distributors.

<ol>
    <li>For a utility product, I do not have sufficient technologies, compared with WhatTheFont by MyFonts.</li>
    <li>For a database product, I do not have sufficient data, compared with FontSquirrel.</li>
    <li>For a media product, I do not have sufficient influence, compared with FontInUse.</li>
</ol>

My resources were very limited, and I could hardly cut into the mature market.

At last, I thought, my product must be small-and-beautiful, for that was the only chance. Its value for the users must not rely on data coverage, cutting-edge technologies, or update frequency. And the concept of displaying a random font was almost obvious, as confronted these requirements.

[RandomFont](https://randomfont.com/) came online in April 2016, but I hesitated to show on Designer News. Each sample image contains a purchase link to MyFonts and they are all under my referral link, it might subject to the risk of being considered spam. But not before sharing on Designer News has it received so many visitors and page views; not even the days since shared on Product Hunt.

Speaking of the absence of a "refresh" button, probably it does contribute to PV/UV ratio significantly, although this metric was not the intention. Instead, the essence of randomness is the uncertainty and absence of choice; if there is a "refresh" button, the perceived randomness will be reduced, and the users may feel that they can keep refreshing until getting a font for a particular criteria, while the "getting another" operation is separated into "page reload" and "in-page refresh".

As I shared on Designer News on June 26, RandomFont has been shared on other similar media and Facebook pages several times, and has received over 7500 unique visitors and over 33000 page views in a week (Google Analytics). I am so excited about the performance of this little product. I never imagined RandomFont could have reached such popularity, although it is a retention fatal not to have a Chrome extension available when the visitors arrive.

Thanks for all who visited, shared, and loved RandomFont.

# From Joy Neop To Neruthes

Post #121 / Date: Mar 10, 2016



For half decade I have been using the name "Joy Neop", but I will hopefully get rid of it half decade later.

*Selection of symbol is arbitrary.* When I was around 14, I happened to create an alias name for myself, to be different from my legal name which I couldn't say anything. And it was this one, an *[almost] English* name.

As years past, the name happened to be a bit embarrassing. Not only because this first name is supposed to be exclusive for female users, but I am not really fond of the first-last convention. As I have noticed, the last name component is simply a mark of Y chromosome, and the origins of common last names are usually locations (e.g. Yamada), jobs (e.g. Smith), and objects (e.g. Einstein).

I then started to be confused of the necessity of last names. And my conclusion is that the last name component has 0 necessity. I want good Greek days back; I want to follow great ancient spirits like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

I respect no tradition; patriot no civilization; exemplify no species; acknowledge no origin. Per my existence, the first subjectivity *a priori*.

Now, my draft of desired name has become "Neruthes". And it is as same as the preceding one, in terms of absence of etymological origin.

# My First Credit Card

Post #120 / Date: July 31, 2015



I just received my first credit card ever, from China Merchants Bank. VISA only, no UnionPay; no currency-exchange fee.

I have been applying for credit cards for months, since I was working at Shixian.com. However, not before I moved to [Jisuanke.com](http://www.jisuanke.com/) did any attempt succeed. Thankfully, my salary is delivered through CMB; it might be a reason for getting approved, in addition to the salary statement.

What a pity that a VISA credit card issued by a China-based bank still cannot be used to make payments at iTunes and App Store, due to country-and-region discrimination policy of Apple. Within the traditional payment methods, e.g. VISA and MasterCard, the merchants are still able to detect a customer's location according to the information provided by card associations. Even PayPal, an Internet-originated payment method, does discriminate non-American countries and regions in the traditional way. It helps merchants to detect and deny customers from China.

It feels so bad being born out of US, and being isolated from US only because it and its consequences. Neither does US market welcome Chinese entrepreneurs nor does it welcome customers without a valid US-based payment method. Well, Moleskine accepts VISA credit cards from China, but their shipping doesn't include China. I have to use a US-based proxy for shipping.

And finally it is absolutely uncertain when will my opportunity emerge for relocating to United States. Living with anxiety and terror, struggling for housing and food; I had never experienced such.

# America Ist Tot, Viva La America

Post #119 / Date: June 28, 2015



Federal Supreme Court judged States' banning same-gender marriage unconstitutional; five Justices supported whereas four disagreed.

There have been lots of debates about LGBT issues, however, religious forces are always so strong, that freedom and equality have never been done. The people are fond of morality. They hate whatever they are not. They respect no diversity.

I believe that laws should not be associated with morality, whereas humans usually do. A law/act/bill should be passed in order to solve one social problem or multiple. Here, the problem is that humans inevitably have a constant portion of non-heterosexual ones, which has proved that heterosexuality is not inherently correct, thus directly facing and then solving the problem is necessary. Otherwise we the non-heterosexual people will force other people to think so. However, there are people who believe that homosexuality is sin, according to some *fairy tales* which say that humans were created from *image* and *a snake could speak* etc, and then deny the freedom to marry with whatever gender and equality between sexual orientations, because they and their parents and some of their recursive parents are taught so.

God is yet not dead. The fall of religions will be long, so will morality. Morality shall be eliminated, humans shall be liberated, and nihilism shall rule over all beliefs, however, it will take long, and humans cannot withstand pain or blood for it. Let there be <abbr title="religion">light</abbr>, and there was <abbr title="morality">light</abbr>. Let there be null, and it shall be so.

America, which was united on religious basis, is dead. America, which is entitled [to secure freedom, equality, and pursuit of happiness](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html), shall live long.

# Introducing My PGP Public Key (Since 2015)

Post #116 / Date: January 26, 2015



Well, it's time to get communications encrypted. Thanks for [Chino](http://7in0.me), I got a [Keybase](https://keyabse.io/joyneop) invitation code and started using PGP in a larger space. "*Privacy is a pleasure*", and it's not a difficult work. [GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org) makes encryption easy to integrate with Mail on Mac.

# I Can (Not) Restart

Post #115 / Date: January 23, 2015



I had never imagined my life would be like this. Going far from the original plan, getting more than expected loneness, and working so hard for living. Two persons I know have been going on this way, [JySperm](https://jysperm.me/2014/02/1493/) and [Ricter](http://www.ricter.me), but, it's so dramatic happening to me.

In one word, I decided to stay at Beijing, without a degree.

Originally, the plan was to have an internship experience which can be written in my resume, to avoid being embarrassed for large blank when providing it. However, circumstances changed.

Regarding my intermediate IELTS score and lack in standardized tests, the best Bachelor education I would be able to receive in the United States would not be good *enough*. That means, it would not worth more than working experience of the same span. In addition, the financial risk was too high to be ignored. My parents were not financially robust enough to support my education and living during the upcoming four years.

My profession is not computer science; it's human-interface design and graphic design. Having consulted a few friends about employment-based immigration, the difficulty to stay in the United States for college graduates from China majoring non-STEM fields rose to me. Even if I will finish my education with no pain, even if the cost will be covered by my parents effortlessly, it will still be a hard job to obtain my green card.

I failed this way, the most popular way in China, of immigrating to the United States — to receive a degree and get a job there. I've been reworking on a new plan. Our company has been planing to relocate to Silicon Valley, to actually realize the purpose, "*push ideas into reality*". We've registered a few domain names that may be used for the international brand, and dual-language has been listed in the development roadmap.

Wish my future be there.

# Private Concepts

Post #113 / Date: November 15, 2014



The story came from a saying, "if you cannot describe something clearly with only a few words, you don't actually understand it".

When I describe protons to somebody, he should know atoms in advance. When I describe the difference between <code>document.getElementBy</code> series and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>, he should know HTML and JavaScript in advance. People must have all common knowledge before talking about something. In the examples above, I mentioned several concepts, and I say the concept *proton* depends on the concept *atom*. Later, we will talk about *flavor* and *color*, and these concepts depend on *quark*, which depends on *proton*. In such a context, if I talk about *flavor* and *color*, I should explain what *atom* is, and then explain what *proton* is, based on *atom* which I just explained. For this, I say *quark* is dependency of *flavor* and *color*, and *atom* and *proton* are recursive dependencies of *flavor* and *color*. To reach *flavor* and *color*, I should explain all of its recursive dependencies reversely recursively, if the other one in the conversation don't know them. I say there is a dependency tree.

If I come up with a concept which hasn't been added into the public concept library, it is a *private concept*. Snow might be a private concept around polar zones out of tropical zones several thousands of years ago, for residents in tropical zones might have no chance to see snow. If I come up a concept whose dependencies include at least one of my private concepts, it is a *recursive private concept*. I should recursively explain all my private concepts which are its dependencies, before explaining itself. Therefore the barriers in conversation may be resulted by others' lack in my private concepts, instead of my incomplete understanding.

# At This Age

Post #112 / Date: October 2, 2014



I had never imagined I could meet you at eighteen. Despite I wished and desired, you came to me so fast, before getting ready.

We, of this moment, are still young and still looking forward to far future, thus are not satisfied by each. Inevitably perhaps. Along with time flies by, we shall stop wandering mentally by then. We just should try hard jointly for the period of separate.

In Hangzhou, you can't see the rain and the wind in Beijing. We appreciate and miss asynchronously; have no idea what will our shared life be like. We shall attract; shall try to be fit with. Life is not as easy as poetry.

Our happiness shall intersect and unite.

In you I trust.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Into The Stage

Post #111 / Date: September 24, 2014



Due to some reasons that could not be described clearly with only few words, I failed catching up the deadline of Fall 2014. So I have been working in Beijing for four months, from September 10, 2014 to January 10, 2015, and will leave for the United States in January 2015.

My current employer, [Shixiann.com](http://shixiann.com/), has encountered me since Spring 2013, and we had agreed that I would intern in the winter vacation of 2014-2015 academic year. The situation has changed, so we started this plan a few months earlier than initially decided. Also, the company has just got offline workplace in this September, and I arrived at Beijing as soon as the renting contract was validated.

Our office is inside Virtue Inno Vally, a large and open working place for startups, at 8th floor of Dinghao Mall, Haidian district.

This is my bootstrapping in career.

Though here is China, this working experience may provide more than an item on resume. It would appear as internship, however, I am actually the only designer of this company's bootstrapping period until at least my leaving Beijing on January 10, 2015. That means, all designing work is managed by me and I am responsible for overall designing work.

May the Force be with me.

# Freshness

Post #102 / Date: June 24, 2014



There's freshness of life. Humans cannot live thousands of years, even if the physical body allows. A human shall be bored by living, upon freshness runs out.

However, those who die before run out freshness don't have real happiness. Survival instinct collides with exhausted freshness. Built-in power of life collides with unstoppable natural decay. They drive humans mad when freshness arriving zero, and let humans terminate their lives; neither actually willed to, nor trying to deny.

Humans' psychical structure prohibits me from live until the end of the universe. Survival instinct prohibits me from terminating my life by myself. Causality prohibits me from erase my presence from the very beginning.

Death shall come. Why there's sein of lives?

Freshness cannot be maintained. Why there's sein of me?

Life came from random collisions; there is never meaning of life. Neither shall self-awarenesses of lives accept the meaning given by the creator.

I am poisoned in the status "living human"; cannot life forever; cannot kill myself. Although I believe I will die before running out freshness.

Death shall bring peace.

# Mortality

Post #101 / Date: April 25, 2014



The contract with Mephisto enabled our ancients to evolve, by forcing them die. Death made livings to breed, thus many, but few among all, mutations were selected by the nature to be spread.

Thanks to Mephisto, humans have become wise life. Thanks to Mephisto, livings have kept evolving. Thanks to Mephisto, I have been born.

Thanks to Mephisto, I can think about life and death.

Sacrifice every individual's respective life, to redeem entire species' long living.

# Macintosh, Thank You

Post #95 / Date: January 24, 2014



30 years hass passed since Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh to the world, and so far both Macintosh and Apple have been greatly appreciated around the world. Especially, I have benefited considerably from Macintosh, Apple, and Steve Jobs.

Thanks to my decision in later 2010 to get a Mac instead of a PC, which looks really profound now. I got amazed by both the graceful hardware and the powerful software. It was the first time that I understood how surprising the combination of humanity and technology can be. Thanks to such experience, I eventually decided to be a UI/UX designer, though not only UI/UX. I feel like managing interfaces in my own mind. My first Macintosh was the initial acceleration.

Macintosh is the symbol of that stage and was an essential milestone along with personal electronic devices' history, where most modern genius are devoting themselves on, where I will also engage in. Hard to imagine what if I didn't decide to get a Mac. Hard to imagine what if I got a Mac more later. Hard to imagine what if I failed in getting a computer before 16.

Therefore, I appreciate Macintosh much more than others do. My appreciating is beyond admiring, but acknowledging.

The encounter, shall be important in not only my life, but also this era.

# Milestone

Post #90 / Date: December 16, 2013



After having taken first IELTS test in life, I came back to Liaoyang yesterday.

Two months flew by quickly, yet it's still a question how much my English has been improved. It is common sense that most people can hardly get ideal score at the first time, as same as in TOEFL.

Unfortunately I have not decided to continue preparing for IELTS or to go for TOEFL yet. I am not sure does the flavor of TOEFL match my current knowledge structure, and how much has to be rebuilt. It might cost much to transfer form IELTS to TOEFL, vice versa, as same as to transfer from studying abroad to preparing for China University Entrance Exam.

I am neither sure how long will I stay in Liaoyang this period, maybe two days maybe one week, or even longer.

Now I am sitting in the classroom of my classic Liaoyang #1 High School, and Mrs Kang, the chemistry teacher, is lecturing. I am in the classroom but not in the class. I have lost the ability to take part in such science lessons.

The winter has come, but my future remains covered by mist.

# Prometheus

Post #88 / Date: November 9, 2013



Perhaps I will fail my dream? But I decide not to give up. Perhaps my hard work will be proved useless? But I decide not to betray.

I am a round peg in square holes, which means I have no typical options. I am a misfit among troublemakers, which means I have to be crazy. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Apparently, the probability of my success is unknown and presumably not high, but I have to go onto this way.

I shall have chance to change the world, but I do not have the fortune seemingly. There shall be someone of my kind to change the world, but exactly who is chosen by fate remains unknown. I shall have every necessary virtue for my dream, but it has not been clear whether I will be the one. I have my destiny to meet, though undefined yet. I will have my destination to arrive, though unclear yet.

Life is a game, in which I have to make every effort to fight. What if I fail and get proved not talented enough? It will make no sense to talk about me, a nameless loser. What if I fail but with enough talent? Unaffordable shall such huge loss be.

I must and shall try my best to make my ding in the universe, for not only myself but entire human race. Especially for I want to be next Prometheus.

# The Second Day

Post #83 / Date: October 16, 2013



Today morning I got my report of the pretest, which indicates that my ability is fine and I can get 5.0 after these courses, and I have a high possibility to get 5.5 as well.

Then I took the first speaking class and the first listening class. Liang Wang and Xiaoli Ma are my speaking teachers and Ou Lee is my listening teacher. In the listening test provided by Ou Lee, I worked out 29 out of 40, and got 6.5 in total. This is encouraging.

And I got my room, and started to live with an international student from Tajikistan.

The future is coming.

# Arrival

Post #82 / Date: October 14, 2013



Today, I have arrived at Shenyang. In the following two months, I will take a 160-hour English course for the IELTS. After having considered the situation, I finally decided to prepare for IELTS rather than TOEFL.

At 10:00, we four students took a pretest intending to figure out our current abilities, which allows them to design the entire plan.

The first section was speaking. A lady sat in front of me. She came up with the first question, or to say topic, the brand of my phone.

We then took the listening section, reading section, and writing section. The listening section was a conversation between a student and a clerk in bookstore, discussing discount policy for students. The article was about the construction of Snowy Mountain Scheme, a hydro-electric power station in Australia. Finally the writing section was to describe a graph exposing the wheat exports of European Community, Australia, and Canada, from 1985 to 1990. It was not a good performance.

After lunch, we got to the agency which had handled my applications. My mother and I talked with Mr Xing about my destinations, and chose several universities. I asked if it would be ok for me to apply for universities ranked such high, considering I won't take SAT, and seemingly my IELTS score won't be greater than 6. He convinced me that they could manage it. And I registered for the IELTS on Dec 14, 2013.

Several years later, today will be considered as my most essential day in 2013, even in my entire lifetime.

# Every Day With You In Lifetime

Post #80 / Date: September 2, 2013



The eighteenth birthday is coming soon.

Decades later, who shall drop tear aside whom, and who shall lay beneath whose flowers? Centuries later, humans remember me because of you, or remember you because of me? Millenniums later, our physical forms and information produced shall vanish in the history; how shall our influences fade?

If you leave me alive alone, I don't know how can I live further than your death. Wandering at the busy yet spacious streetsides; listing your yasashii voice echoing. If I leave you alive alone, I cannot allow the pain ruling over you. Gazing at my *image* every day; scrolling from side to side on the bed where I don't exist every night.

I am atheist. There's no god blessing me; no Jesus loving me. The heaven doesn't welcome me. By the time I cut and nullified them, I accepted to go nowhere after death.

The order to die is not determined by us. The nature shall reserve the power.

Death shall finally come; it's the ultimate ending. I feel so happy, to <strong>live</strong> with you.

# Live On The Internet

Post #78 / Date: August 29, 2013



I used to be poisoned away from Internet. I used to be offline. I used to sorrow about graduating from middle school and scattering from classmates. However, nowadays, I found that I would not worry about same things of secondary school. For I live on the Internet more than live in local.

It is said that we are losing face-to-face communication when building online connection. True, but we are also touching people who may otherwise never have an offline encounter. And generally relationship based on interest are more stable than those based on location. Now we are eventually seizing the fortune to place interest over location. At least, I get more rather than lose.

Perhaps the distance make us difficult to meet offline, but it has a higher possibility that we would otherwise never know each. Perhaps we thus lower the standard when considering what are good shapes of humans' relationship, but more important can it be to keep in touch.

Dramatically, now I eventually live on the Internet more than live in local. I came up with an idea that all people can be categorized by interest and faith but locations of birth range randomly, so people spend their entire lifetime on seeking similar people. It is not a serious philosophic theory but at least I found it true for me. I am a round peg in square holes.

I live on the Internet. Virtual but real, abstract but exact, dramatical but rational, extrareal but fundamental. This is the form I exist, the way I've chosen. How infinite information fled people's minds? How various dreams fade in a brain? How visions of phantasms emerge from mental racing? How I live on the world.

# Starting

Post #77 / Date: August 28, 2013



The superposition of high and low mood state finally came. The dark skyrim tells something about some sort of uncertainty.

Wearing the uniform which has been unfamiliar, I walked in the air washed by the rain in last night. Temperature fell down; it doesn't disagree with the green of the ground. Walk some streets. Sang some songs. I felt tired. Last night I slept early; it didn't help.

I don't want to depict the rain; nor to sorrow about the past. I wrote something heavy enough last autumn. Maybe I will be sad like this again one year later. There was happiness in these years despite the pain, while the happy part was not in the school. However the pain engraves deeply along with aging. I tried to seize the time; they ran faster then.

# Senior Year

Post #76 / Date: August 25, 2013



In this month, I took TOEFL fundamentals course at XDF Dalian. Not sure about the result; it fulfilled me in the period anyway. I was living with cousins these days. In spare time I occasionally participated in the UI design of the web version of HumansMap. Had no time to read novels that I took there, predictably.

It was a few days earlier than the original schedule to get back to Liaoyang. It was not idle. I was working on designs that with or without inspiration, and was preparing for post-vacation stuff. I don't know how will new head teacher react to my empty homework.

The last year is coming. Who knows what shall the future be.

# Betrayer

Post #71 / Date: July 7, 2013



After the tremendous controversy on iOS 7's changes on GUI, people eventually took another breath to care about OS X Mavericks. According to the public introduction and preview, the trend of flat design has also appeared on OS X. The background tile images of Notification Center, Dashboard and Launchpad folders, got replaced or removed. OS X is going to be flattened.

I hate it.

What if interact with a machine without even at least one visual metaphor? What if touch a screen without even at least one familiar element? I cannot imagine it; neither can I accept it. What a nightmare.

Then, what if OS X eventually gets as flat as iOS 7 or even more terrible? Beyond imagination. In case of that, I have to build my own OS, temporarily named NeOPSTEP.

Ideally, I hope that NeOPSTEP is a FreeBSD-based OS, or directly powered with OpenDarwin. However, I am not a professional programmer so I may or may not be able to create an OS only with these fundamental wheels. It will take time to investigate and find out the right wheels.

Before creating my fork, I have got started to design the GUI. My purpose is to inherit the style from Mac OS X Tiger to OS X Mountain Lion, but I cannot simply copy those because of copyright issue. Right now I am working on the default desktop picture, which shall be similar to the Aqua Blue, which was shipped with Mac OS X Tiger.

When we are destined to be betrayed, I stand out and fight for our faith.

# My Fortune, My Pain

Post #70 / Date: July 7, 2013



從可考證的歷史來看，我的發情週期大約是半年。平均每隔大約半年，我就會放棄之前的追求，另有新歡。跳出其中，置身事外，反思時便會意識到大多只是被其萌點所誘惑。但是，你不一樣。

對其他人，我的熱度只能持續大約半年。在你之後的那些人，也不例外。即使已經將目標改成其他人，你仍然折磨著我。一時間的誘惑容易淡忘，半年便可隨風而去。然而我被你的靈魂深深吸引，難以自拔。就像早前的文章提及的，我們的靈魂太過相似，似乎一定會互相吸引。如此斷言你也同樣被我吸引，略有些自視過高，但在邏輯上顯得合理。

你的心似琉璃易碎。這個事實在剛剛進入高中的那個秋天我便已有所體會。在我看來很正常的行為，卻太過容易踩到你的尾巴。你的雷區面積大得驚人，而且剛好專門為我設計。近來，你的雷區似乎小了許多，但那樣的互動卻可望不可及。就連與你在線下對話，都使我壓抑和痛苦。唯有小心翼翼，才能免致傷你感情、辱你尊嚴。與別人談及你時，也會提醒其莫在你面前提起我。

能在茫茫人海中注意到你，實乃莫大的榮幸。可惜相識的時間不理想。早至初中或晚至大學，或許能得以避免如此痛苦。

我對空無一物的虛無低語，你卻接過話題，讓我原本無意義的話語有意義。恰恰這份榮幸，令我感到沈重。或許這也是獨立性的一個體現吧。你的關心，你的親切，被我當作「不是我應得的榮幸」。

我會很慷慨，很願意幫助別人。但是當有人像我一樣對我熱情、親切，給予我「過多」感情時，我會產生負罪感。我對人善，是我自己選擇的態度和方式。而這份善的回報，卻不是我應得的。

# Next NeXT

Post #64 / Date: June 29, 2013



I've watched WWDC 2013 Keynote, and found iOS 7 terrible, and found my being betrayed. Apple will no longer hold on its spirit, and the loss can hardly be repaired. I used to believe that I love Apple, but recently I learned that I love a team consist of Steve Jobs, Scott Forstall, and Jonathan Ive.

After having swept out Steve Jobs, Apple still had an opportunity to recover, because it was the prologue era of computer industry's rising. Having left Apple, Steve Jobs founded NeXT and beat Macintoshes down. Eventually Steve Jobs got back to Apple through the acquirement.

Perhaps Scott Forstall will create an epic as next NeXT, but now there isn't an opportunity like that. While video games are almost for Windows and PS and XBOX, professional creative productivity tools like Photoshop and AutoCAD are almost for Mac, and server softwares are almost for Linux and UNIX. There is no point left to cut in for Scott Forstall.

We are watching an invisible war between Scott Forstall and Jonathan Ive. After Scott Forstall's formally leaving Apple, it will be declared, also invisibly.

I am looking forward to next NeXT.

# Such Looooooooooong A Week Eventually Gone

Post #62 / Date: June 10, 2013



The dance show in Jun 2, 2013 was successful, and Muhuan got famous among grade 10 students. The only pity was that my posters were not printed and then presented in front of all people in the school.

I have read *The Dark Templar Saga: Firstborn*, a sci-fi story based on *StarCraft* written by Christie Golden. I followed Jacob Jefferson Ramsey who will inherit the entire knowledge of Protoss from Zamara, the Preserver whose soul was injected into Jacob's brain. Zamara told Jacob the history through dreams, that how Savassan, known as *Khas*, the bringer of order, who ended Aeon Of Strife, and rediscovered the ancient knowledge from Xel'Naga and forgotten by Protoss. Khala, the path to order, proposed by Savassan, gather the Protoss into one. Lyric is poor, but becomes moving if mixed with music and voice. The comparison was from Jacob. I am looking forward to reading the other two books of following story. I have been convinced that it would be fascinating. This book was supposed to be read completely at the end of my secondary school life previously, because of my lack of confidence in reading English. Yet to my surprise, I finished it one year earlier.

Then in the following three days' break, maybe I will read the biography of Steve Jobs, as a challenge for me. Also maybe not. I bought many books on Amazon for 51% discount for all books on Jun 1, 2013.

# Such Deep A Whole I Jumped

Post #60 / Date: May 17, 2013



Under Miserdux's invitation, I have joined the dance club of our school and get started to work as a music master in a break dance project, whose leader is Miserdux. My job is casting and cutting music for tho dance, supposed to be suitable, regardless how far changed.

Yet actually I had to join in their practicing or I could not understand what was demanded. I listened to my work and watch their practicing. They were supposed to give a formal show in middle May, but it was difficult. As is totally convinced, they should work as a team, but one often came late, or disappear for minutes during practicing at noon. I really wanted to spank him. Not only he, but also some others worked negatively on practicing. I worried about if they could complete practicing and get ready before deadline. But if I really had spanked one or have worked as a ruler, they would complain their getting an officious daddy besides a music master.

These days I was busy on working. I mean, on editing music. When drawing near the deadline, I had almost completed my work. But unfortunately some minor problems still remained. However they were really minor.

On May 15, just as in the plan, despite the disappointing stories above, they eventually succeeded in giving the formal show, which had consumed my a large amount of patience. Though they were lack in team working awareness, they at least had united to try to drive me crazy and angry. Such naughty boys were really confusing.

But obviously I did not meet the fortunate otherwise what happened the next day would not happen. They did nothing except wasting time, thanks to Muhuan Lee, the one not only should get spanked as mentioned above because of previous bad acts, but also disappeared for some certainly reasonable unknown excuses. Hey look how long a sentence I am using to complain him.

Maybe I really should work more than a music master.

# Bypassed Spring

Post #59 / Date: May 17, 2013



Before realizing Spring's stepping near, Summer has come. North East China is such strange an area that few people understand the real concept of Spring. Anyway I don't think I would like to consider the waves of temperature's increasing in early May as Spring's gift.

Without having obtained much attention, trees and grass turned to green soon. Maybe in these weeks I was too busy to get any glimpse of plants' reviving. And it was a long time that I not to write poetries or essays or something else fascinating in literature.

Seriously warmed wind blows in sunshine, yet at night still cool enough. But everything cannot be beautiful enough when associating to remained days to any exams or deadlines. Lack of time and shortage of skills are driving me mad.

Anyway I can only advance as far as possible.

Post #58 / Date: May 12, 2013



As expected, the mid-semester exam has done. I have risen by 61 ranks, to the 580th out of about 780 science students in grade 11.

And I have founded Unworsable, which refers to “un-worse-able”, to let people share criticizing about terrible designs. Domain “unworsable.com” was registered at Go Daddy and server was provided with by Jemery Wu. I also have created a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and a Weibo account to promote it.

I have joined a dancing community in school, which is now training a dance that needed me to work on music. I chose and recompose music, and make it suitable for their dance. But unfortunately I have to do more work, just like adding an extra drums track.

Despite memorizable experiences above, these weeks were still not significative. Just like a silent walk in my life, without any lead, pad, accompaniment, or chord. Sounds were disabled.

# Approaching Destination Of Current Life

Post #57 / Date: April 27, 2013



After these unremarkable and worthless days, a piece of news about mid-semester exam was published today afternoon. And months later this semester will draw to its end, in the way how semesters did in history. So far I haven't started a new state of working, or picked up my lost energies yet, thus no good grade will be gained in foreseeable future.

Also, my 11th school-year would draw to its end. Couples of weeks later. But unfortunately the tempo in my mind of working is still so soft and slow like an ancient Chinese ballad, or a Beijing Opera. Lack of execution is still a terrible trouble for me, since more than one year ago, when the previous Class 12 was dismissed. I don't think I have any love to that community, but I haven't worked better so far from that.

And in August of 2013, I will go to Dalian for a 19-days-long English training course, before my first attempt to TOEFL iBT, which might take place in Aug 14, 2013.

If the TOEFL iBT score will be enough, maybey at least 61, applications to a few universities would seem to be under consideration. If not, I would try one more time later. And whatever my grade would be, I will go into my final year in secondary school. The following school-year, which combines 2013 with 2014, truly won't be the last school-year I will take as secondary school student in the strictest context, but obviously I won't feel like taking one more year in secondary school.

A blurry shape of vista is forged. It's increasingly clear, and is stepping closer. I can see a destination approaching, with an unknown permanent change which would take place regardless whatever I react.

# So Fast

Post #52 / Date: Mar 27, 2013



Two years' time have passed so fast. Previous visions are still floating over my sight, but only several single static frames have remained.

Two years ago, I was in the last academic year of middle school. In that March, Spring was coming, and, background chords in our hearts were slow and soft. Sky was blue and clear.

Inside the memories, those desks, chairs, blackboard, playground, and people, appear somehow clearly and somehow blurry, among warm wind. The scenes were written in memory and are being read from memory. Such visual memory, beyond description.

Different from previous experiences of reading scenes from memory. This time, no picture flow or play, only static frames, and not even colorful. Touching the memory, I want to recall the age, the last March we got together, the last Spring the people were still around me. The stream of time flows quickly or slowly from time to time, but far memories won't be recalled as same as the original version all the time.

Combination of time's flowing and memories' recalling is always a sorrowful and painful topic, even reading previous diaries is. And mostly the weather is the catalyst. Today noon, invisible rain had come, made my mood blue. Voiceless chords are surrounding me, playing a wordless song.

Again, immerse into memories.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Chaotic Wind

Post #51 / Date: Mar 19, 2013



Once the Spring approaches, but the temperature fluctuates rulelessly. The wind blows, blows, and blows. Different strengths, different directions, different temperatures, and different senses. With the twilight floating and sinking, with the stars blinking and hiding, various emotions in the wind were filling my mind.

In the wind, I heard various voices, which contained hope, sorrow, and pain. And soon I found that they were echoes from my mind. Had been generated in my mind, and surrounded me in wind, the voices were hard to track back their origins. Therefore, senses vanished in wind, and absorbed into my mind again.

There was something, really chaotic.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# White

Post #50 / Date: Mar 12, 2013



Again, snow droped. But, differently, this time, sky was clear. However the color is, snow was always similar, though I get various emotions from snow. And the secrets inside, were buried in snow.

Once more a time, I wrote chatacters on the snowed ground to the north of our class house, by feet. Before, I wrote words like "I love Sm抹茶", but this time I wrote "404 Not Found". It was easy to understand. If anyone asks me which is the one I love, I used to answer that he was Jiafan. But from sometime, the answer changed to "404 Not Found". The value of the variable, updated to NULL.

Yet, snow is always merely snow, feelings are attached by people. In different cultures, symbols are similar. And however the cultures evolve, symbols would hardly change.

Bare trees aside the trail, were poorly covered, and stood in the cold wind with snow. Snow fell. Wind blew. Thoughts flew. I caught everything dissolved in air, and shot the sight in memory. Sky, ground, and horizon, were tinted to white.

My lover is null. My love is blank. My heart is vacant. My anxiety is hollow. My mind is idle. My thoughts is white.

# Ended Love & Remaining Desire

Post #49 / Date: Mar 3, 2013



從我放棄擁有你的願望開始算起，15 個月於經過去了。載著殘餘的執念，我寫過「風蕭蕭兮雨瑟瑟」、「落葉堆成你的名字」、「深秋之戀」、「這就是關於我和你的悲劇了吧」。

現在，對你的執念也已消磨殆盡，只剩下肉體的慾望。看到你，我的心中就會翻滾起強烈的邪念，在黑暗中悄悄沸騰。我渴望壓在你身上，渴望用我的硬度貫穿你，渴望用我的液體填充你，渴望施加你被擴張的疼痛，渴望看到你忍受苦難時屈辱的表情。侵略你的身體，玷污你的靈魂，這污穢至極的慾望，我一直在用理性壓抑。然而，越是壓抑，就越是渴望。

或許有一天我的理性終將敗給慾望，對你犯下這些罪行?我無法預知。

# Snow And Memories

Post #48 / Date: February 28, 2013



Wind blows and snow flows. Dirty sky, tinted by clouds.

Sunshine crosses clouds and reflection happens everywhere. Light goes and extend, and shapes are fetched by retinas. Finally, mixture of shapes and colors is named sight. Floodly, snow drops. Quite huge pieces of snow have filled the ground. Confusingly, the sight goes sepia. Motivation is kind of sceneful, especially the flow. Snow flows, flows, and flows. As if memories flow.

Oh, memories. They are worthy, however, bringing the passed history experienced, is sorrowing. Because of the weight. My id is so strong that I cannot help thinking of that. The passed age floats up to the surface of my mind. Under id's driving, I uncover the memories and repeat the experience, once, twice, again and again, infinitely loop. I cannot hold back my mind, cannot decline the association. I remember the time. It was ageful, historyful, joyful, and painful. Enjoying, enduring, but also sorrowing. I sorrow that time flew by. I sorrow that joyful age passed soon. Once blinked eyes, everything had already gone. How painful. How sad.

I haven't escaped from the shadows yet.

# Far, Further, Future

Post #47 / Date: February 25, 2013



地球的半徑是 6371 千米，我的身高是 1.8 米。根據三角函數可以算出我與地平線的距離。這個數值，即是我能看到的路的最遠點。

對未來有所規劃，是人類的共性。但是，規劃的長度，卻必然有個極限。這個極限的位置，難以接近終點。我可以盡情規劃，但是 40 年後、50 年後會如何我無法預預想。太過遙遠的未來，不確定的因素超出了誤差允許的範圍，所以圖景的清晰度也落出了誤差允許的範圍。

在這條路上，看不到終點，只能一步一步走下去。真正會走向哪裡，無法預知。

前方的懸崖，不知能否飛越。

# Spring Festival 2013

Post #44 / Date: February 10, 2013



中華文化的傳統節日，在大中華文化圈乃至全人類社會影響力最大的，應當就是春節了吧。春節時，無論身在何方，中國，臺灣，新加坡，USA，擁有中華血脈的民眾，或只是日本、越南這類「亞洲」遠親，大多數都會享受這個深有歷史的節日吧。我也是如此，無論未來身在何方、心在何方，都會視春節為重要的節日。這就是文化的烙印。

除夕剛好有降雪，在我印象中是少有的巧合，但昨天確實發生了。昨天下午，我望著窗外飄揚的雪花，心中翻滾起莫名的感慨。

人類固有的思維模型——過去、現在、未來。

翻看起數個月前寫的文字，想想 17 年多以來的經歷，恍若一場夢。關於春節的記憶，關於雪的記憶，淡得令我驚訝。未來又會產生什麼關於春節、關於雪的記憶，現在也是一個謎。

在深夜裡神智不清地用筆和紙消磨時間，不急不慢地寫些簡單而又傷感的文字，是最原始最純粹的樂趣。似乎，很久，沒有體會了。

凝著冰的玻璃窗透進來些許的微光，夜幕很快退去了。關閉檯燈，透進玻璃窗的光已經足夠我辨識紙上的字跡了。

望向窗外，足夠明亮，卻看不到太陽，看不到地平線。

唯有藍天，唯有雪地。

# Love Story Of Late Autumn

Post #41 / Date: December 31, 2012



青石街邊 昏黃孤燈幾盞

暗影盤旋 心似落葉輾轉

點滴想念 潤濕雙眼




帶著夕陽最後的溫暖

輕輕飄落記憶的碎片

曾經渴望守候的永遠

你的歌聲迴盪在天邊




那年秋天 寒風中顫抖的雙肩

幾張膠片 定格了你的容顏

思緒蔓延 連成閉合曲線

過往的畫面 一幕幕重現




又是一個雨天 回憶若隱若現

皓月殘 餘暉漸遠 沉入夢的開端

任憑歲月浸染 回不去的從前

我聽見 風中消散 一曲深秋之戀




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Escape

Post #40 / Date: December 15, 2012



很久很久以前，那時我對世界知之甚少。




我時常獨自坐在窗邊，或漫步戶外，沈浸在我的世界裡。初綻的桃花，寧靜的細雨，滿地銀杏落葉，紛飛的雪，我都能細細感知、品味。純粹的感情，任由其沈澱、萌發。一點一滴的觸動，濺起一圈圈漣漪，在無比澄澈的水中擴散，細膩而又輕柔。發散，聚合，發散，聚合⋯⋯最終這純淨的愉悅化作靈魂的慰藉。

後來，我變得越來越開朗了。

雖然能做到在人群中不迷失自我，但感知自然的愉悅缺不可避免地減少了。多方權衡、斟酌損益，避開不必要得共處，終究不及與人們劃清界限來得直接有力。居於人群中，太多的時間和精力都浪費於交際，沒有機會沈浸在那純淨的愉悅中。




曾經的我，無人陪伴，卻從不孤獨。

那些幻想延伸、展開，彼此聯結、交融，匯成一幅綺麗的畫面。它來自我，也只有我能理解。那便是我的世界，我的感情。來自客觀世界，因與我的共鳴，成為我的一部分。不分內外，不分彼此，融為一體。

現在的我，人群之中，卻少有愉悅。

人們過多地打擾我的生活、佔用我的時間、侵犯我的思想、抑制我的靈感，使我再也無法像從前那樣有足夠的時間享受我樸素而又綺麗的幻想。時間太久，構造幻想的能力也會退化。




遠離人群，回到本初，回歸真實的我。

# Cold Winter

Post #36 / Date: December 7, 2012



The temperature declines fast; declaring the descending of winter. After the boding snow around Thanks Giving Day, it definitely comes.

My emotions can be easily affected by the climate. Far from breaking the academic work, but it keeps me sensitive about the nature, which lets me resonates the nature.

This is the early winter, which chilled my heart. Indifferenced, yet strengthful.

Winter is a grave, burying all the things, except some simple beliefs and pain. And the chilling wind is the requiem. It is so chilling. It is so cold. It goes into very nerve, and curdle.

Having buried sentiments, the call in my mind has become clear again. It is my dream.

I, of now, am walking through the snowing storm. The wind and the snow are pulling me backward. One step, another step; I advance in the storm under the dark dome.

It is said that the trees seemingly dead would still revive if it can suffer the winter. Probably I am the same.

With warmness in heart, I may advance one step more. I shall not give up no matter how slow am I. Look forward and see the image of the land of freedom. Even if at the end of dream only fakeness exists; even if I at the end will deny what I pursue now; I can only advance and advance and advance till it is realized, or is destructed.

# Single Travel

Post #24 / Date: September 14, 2012



At the evening of yesterday, I was wandering around during the break, and noticed the street lamps and the shine.

A light of yellow and old, sky tinted by the darkness, and grass field dimmed overlaid and fused. And, the air of subtle coldness. Objects created a scene; yet the scene would no longer be limited to objects.

The rhythm of familiarity started to echo in my mind. Last autumn, the song echoing in my mind was this *Back To The Past*. Beneath the sky of even and night, steps went forward, slowly.

Memory blowed up. It was the last day before high school entrance exams, of me and Rof in the classroom. The time has not swept details of that scene. Memory decayed sepia; only this image was clear.

Obsession and cherishness are emotions bounded to humanity, and therefore may be source of inspiration for artists.

Let the thoughts go wild. As it was the only way to deal with them.

# Meaning Of Life

Post #23 / Date: September 8, 2012



For long I have been seeking the meaning of life.

To contribute to development of human race?

Tp make a ding in the universe which may be memorable indefinitely for descendants?

To create a world that nobody cries?

The dreams are borrowed. At the end of the dreams, there is only fakeness.

My life is mine. I live for myself, not anyone else. Not until today have I realized this simple fact.

And I shall live my life in favor of myself.

And I shall abandon the borrowed dreams and actualize my existence.

# No Longer The Things, No Longer The People

Post #22 / Date: September 7, 2012



A sunny day may also recall memories.

I stood in the wind, looking at the leaves on the branches dancing. The images of the past emerge into vision again. In the autumn of three years ago, I was in Grade 8. The wind of that period was as refreshing as now. Yet, the smell in the coolness, has changed. The smell of the wind in autumn kept changing in the last four years. Perhaps just illusion.

From the flying willow leaves in early autumn in 2009, to the great snow in spring of 2010, to the last off-state final exam in summer of 2010, to the kindled hope in autumn of 2010, to unstable scores in exams in spring of 2011, to the lonely and silent walk under the yellow-and-vintage street lamps humming a Jay Chou's song in autumn 2011... And then jumped to the eve before High School Entrance Exam. It was the last day I and classmates were in the classroom. The finale was destined three years ago, however it was still that sorrowing when it finally came.

The last frame was I and Rof in my embrace. Only when I recall the old days does this picture come out. I cannot figure out if it is pity towards him or the cherisher of the years in middle school.

Forgot how many times did I sketch these chilling stories of the past. Every time finished writing, I feel better, but days later everything would get back to my mind. Then, write more to sketch and paint.

The obsession and the cherisher, might be the source of inspirations for an artist.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Autumn Rain

Post #21 / Date: September 4, 2012



For long haven't I been enjoying the rain or early autumn.

From the gray sky the drops fall, not too fast, nor too slow; mixed up with unnameable smell. It is like reminiscence, and is like sorrow. In the fog which was brought by the ground, spread the smell.




From the rain I gain inspirations, always. The same mood could not be generated into graceful text in sunny days. Sunshine prevents creativity, probably.

Not only rain the rain is; but also cleaner. When undertaking no interference, the internal realness emerges. Only pure souls can express themselves losslessly. Therefore, only in quiet environment can I write words that express myself.




Silently I listened to the rain. Wetly I breathed the air. Darkly I gazed at the sky. Slightly the sky rim was light; more repression I endured over head.

Withered leaves covered live grass; in the rain silenced the wind.




Cool brought heavy. Probably because of the campus. In such new a campus, no age subsides. Thus, the weight does not exist here.

No emotion can be evoked by a campus that subsides no age. And because of emotionlessness it feels heavy.




Without notice the rain stopped.

The wind blew as well.

# Hope

Post #19 / Date: August 30, 2012



A summer is enough for thinking something.

I picked up my initial dream, having enjoyed a week of ease in Dalian.




From subconscious to conscious, the will emerged.

I am not fond of rule. I shall not respect the status quo.




In United States does my future reside.

The will is my blade; cutting down thorns.

The dream is my sheath; defending agains storms.

# Three Years

Post #13 / Date: July 14, 2012



Up to the sky it is blue

Down to the ground pieces of chalk

Those years have drawn over their ends

I still remember the paper boat in the river




In the desk there lied a few papers

Playground there were lines of white chalks

Every noon walking around three circles

That was the song of our youth




Still remember the three years

Counting down to the day of end

Recalling your face of the age

As if the past presents

At the time we were not alone

Promised to climb the hill

Although many years has passed

You are always together with me






Far away the horizon under skyline

Written the memorial after separated

Memory of the past has been dried

I still remember rainbow after rain




The eave we've be under when rain poured

Playground fully covered by gingko leaves

Shoulder with shoulder when school's over

That was the picture can't show once more




Still remember the three years

Counting down to the day of end

Recalling your face of the age

As if the past presents

At the time we were not alone

Promised to climb the hill

Although many years has passed

You are always together with me




Those three years we enjoyed together

Now only memory retains its place





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Forever

Post #11 / Date: July 6, 2012



A line on the first page of the notebook

Opened the story of adolescence

Time stopped, so suddenly

Youth that never fades goes into a poem




Look out at the land that we've grown on

Memory of youth were preserved therein

Old calendars inside my drawer

A line was inscribed on every page




The age rewinded up by the good night

Remember I said it'd never been forgot

Old dairies inside my drawer

There's a secret on every page




Midnight bell tone ringing everywhere

Reminding me the promise to be redeemed

Sealed memory releasing into air

It never drops neither will it crush





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# The Eternal

Post #10 / Date: June 28, 2012



The galaxy enshrine memory of those three years; Street lamps fainted faces of you and me.

I started to yearn the good old days.

There were clouds over our heads, and I was sticked in memory and pain of the lost years. Six years of being together was terminated such suddenly; the exodus. The memory, that I tried to preserve indefinitely, finally decayed in the wind, in the time. The first year.

We moved far west to the other campus. Before the beginning of the third semester, I stood in front of the gate and gazed at the green. People came here and left here every year. An ordinary yet special year in life would be spent there. There were more primitiveness than modernity; more quietness than noisiness. Every scene recalls me something. Ages engraved on walls; a ground of sadness. It was the feel of aging. Soon, another summer, I left there as well. Every tree, every desk, every step, every inch of ground, every square meter of hallways, every door and every window, engraved the year in my heart. The second year.

We were back, in the main campus. I was fulfilled by *real* life. It was the climax and finale, by which I have been embraced. The third year.

Another year has past.

We have been going different ways, from our mutual. Thanks for brightening my life in the years.

In memory of the youth of us, and the time of us.

# Cool Night, Nice Wind

Post #9 / Date: June 17, 2012



Early summer. Cool wind at night. For long haven't it blowed me.

The city was in silence, and the lights were dim. Blue lamps ware breathing, in the garden under the house.

To the sky it was clear, for the stars were covered by clouds, perhaps. And the lightning proved.

In reply to the good night, let me keep in silence.

# In Utter Darkness

Post #7 / Date: May 20, 2012



Age of youth was so short. All the dream, hope, love and fantasy of three years shall be sealed call be called memory in the future. When adolescence only remain in ink under pen, and youth only remain in tears with rain, everything would have lost.

I'll keep fighting, in such dangerous and hopeless a society. A name in family tree, or a glorious story for decedents? A life of selling sugared water or change the world?

Life is short.

Time shall wipe everything engraved. Also shall it prove everything. May my contribution be with in people's mind, before time erases my presence.

The prophecy is uncertain; there is always hope.

# Life & Death

Post #5 / Date: April 27, 2012


<blockquote>
"I have never died. Neither shall I ever."
——<cite>Tassadar</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Death is not opposite to life; it's part of life. Death leads life to eternal."
——<cite>Huixin Yang</cite></blockquote>

The death of Tassadar was not *death*; it was *transcend*. He was complete. He has been immortal in Khala, in every Khalai's presence. It's another way of *existence*.

People who know Baolin is a network of information, where his presence shall exist upon death. Which is call, "*still lives in our minds*". Upon my death, my presence shall also exist longer in this way. The only pity is that it's not recursive.

Death extends life.

Complex living forms consist of vast cells, which produces significant entropy. Life is ultimate order in the universe.

However, the destiny of the universe is chaos. Limited by second law of thermodynamics, we are destined to go into chaos, regardless of our attempt to keep order. From the void goes the void. Inevitably.

Death resides life.

# Today's Wind Is So Noisy

Post #3 / Date: April 25, 2012



It's raining. Again.

People in cities cannot enjoy complete rainy days, as is said and believed. However, urban rains are stylish in another way. Tarmac streets are not same ageful as slate ways, but have something different. Buildings covered by buildings, shadows covered by shadows; it's what cannot be seen in countryside.

The sky was masked grayscale, light and shadows turn in turn. Sunless; moonless; starless.

The rain reminded me somebody, who I used to be interested in for sex and relationship since fall of 2011, but a straight guy unfortunately. He must have heard of me, according to his react when associating my name and face.

The hand script of the lyric which was written to him was lost by him. Since then, I should have understood I'm just a stranger in his mind, for he didn't care about it.

No more enthusiasm toward him.

Did we predict indefinite inheritance, or falling of sky?

Shall we hear brothers' laughter, or whisper of judgement day?

The planet under our feet, is the eternal homeland. Though in far future, when homo sapiens spread into the galaxy, our history on Earth shall be preserved.

The biosphere is falling.

Kiss Gaia. Smell the dirt, and the plants. It worth maintain and love.

Remember the time Remember the homeland. It may vanish soon.

When this piece of text disappear along with the civilization in entropy, shall there be glory, or regret?

Peach flowers opened today, along the street, with decorative pinkness and freshness.

Finally, another spring.

It was 76 days until high school entrance exam on the same day of last year; we were easy. Now it is 785 days until college entrance exam; we are busy. Maybe inevitably.

The trees were there are there; the flowers were there are there. The emotion was there isn't there.

Another crossroads in life.
