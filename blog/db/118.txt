<h3>Ultimatism</h3>
<p>Humans have been studying the world for long. It was believed that the world was rational, was designed by some sort of omnipotent intelligence, namely God. Humans used to believe that by some means (e.g. talking to God) humans can fully understand the <em>rules</em> of the world. They believed that the world was designed to be with precision and accuracy, which allow humans to comprehend and describe.</p>
<h3>Approximatism</h3>
<p>Another group of humans believe that there are no such <em>rules</em> behind the world. The facts that can be observed are like solutions of some equations, while given non-infinite solutions there are infinite equations that allow all the solutions valid. The same given limited elements of an indefinite series, there are unlimited formulas for it. Intelligent beings can come up with equations constitute all observations so far under the equations, and data of experiments stand for them so far so firmly. When a new observation or experiment result comes up to challenge a guessed equation, we update it or develop a new one from scratch.</p>
<p>Uncountable events happen in the universe every nanosecond, far beyond observability of any being, so it's technically impossible to believe any equation so far so good can remain good indefinitely. All we can do is just to keep observing and keep updating. Stay hungry for upcoming observations and stay foolish with approximate equations. Precision and accuracy shall never be with us.</p>
