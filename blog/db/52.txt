<p>Two years' time have passed so fast, therefore, previous visions are still floating over my sight, but only several single static frames have remained.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was in the last school-year of middle school. In that March, Spring was coming, and, background chords in our hearts were slow and soft. Such blue sky was very clear, and fascinating.</p>
<p>Inside the memories, those desks, chairs, blackboard, playground, and people, somehow clearly and somehow blurry appear, with the warm wind blow, the scenes were written in memory and is being read from memory. Such visual the memory, beyond description.</p>
<p>Different from previous experiences of reading scenes from memory, this time, no picture flow or play, only static frames available, and not even colorful. Touching the memory, I want to recall the age, the last March we got together, the last Spring the people were still among me. The stream of time flows quick or slow from time to time, but far memories won't be stored as the original state all the time, regardless of the time's flow.</p>
<p>Combination of time's flowing and memories' recalling is always a sorrowing and painful topic, even reading previous diaries is included. And mostly the weather is the catalyst. Today noon, invisible rain had come, resulted my blue mood. Voiceless chords were surrounding me, generating a wordless song.</p>
<p>Again, sink into memories.</p>
