<p>When I gaze at other designers' work, I find me less professional. When I read other programmers' codes, I find me less talented. But I do not have to compare me with them, for I seek much much more.</p>
<p>Great revolutions never come from one single breakthrough. Multiplied UNIX by open source, Linus and Richard got Linux. Multiplied multi-touch screen by specifically redesigned human-interface, Steve, Scott and Jonathan got iPhone. It is not simply adding one onto another, or plus, it is multiplying. Combining is much much more than simply mixing.</p>
<p>This is also true for human individual development, I think, besides for human society. As a designer, I may or may not be greatly outstanding though professional enough, but what if I am also good at programming as same as a graduate from Computer Science major? What if I can also do globalization work for China market? What if I can be glue in a team? What if I can manage both products and visual identity?</p>
<p>I may or may not be the best, but at least I can be unique. My value is the product of various factors with their respective exponents, obvious or potential, such as designing skills, programming skills, photography skills, literature knowledge, traveling experience, cultural background, ability of associating, and much much more. Therefore I can change the world, at least a small part in my domain, in my own way, with my own methodology. Everyone has his own way which cannot be outlined in advance by prior people, and thus everyone explores his own way. It is the way to explore. It is the way to extreme. It is the way to 42.</p>
