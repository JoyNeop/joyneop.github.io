<p>When I gaze at other designers' work, I find me less professional. When I read other programmers' codes, I find me less talented. But I do not have to compare me with them, for I seek much more.</p>
<p>Great revolutions never come from one single breakthrough. Multiplied UNIX by open source, Linus and Richard got Linux. Multiplied multi-touch screen by specifically redesigned human-interface, Steve, Scott and Jonathan got iPhone. It is not simply adding one onto another, or plus, it is multiplying. Combining is not simply mixing.</p>
<p>This is also true for individual development, I think, not only for the society. As a designer, I may or may not be greatly outstanding though professional enough, but what if I am also good at programming? What if I can also do globalization work for China market? What if I can be glue in a team? What if I can manage both products and visual identity?</p>
<p>I may or may not be the best, but at least I can be unique. My value is the product of various factors with their respective exponents, obvious or potential, e.g. designing skills, programming skills, photography skills, literature knowledge, traveling experience, cultural background, ability of associating, and more. Therefore I can change something, at least a small part in my domain, in my way, with my methodology. Everyone has his own way which cannot be outlined in advance by prior people, and thus everyone explores his own way. It is the way to explore, the way to extreme, and the way to 42.</p>
