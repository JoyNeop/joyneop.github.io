<p>I've watched WWDC 2013 Keynote, and found iOS 7 terrible, and found my being betrayed. Apple will no longer hold on its spirit, and the loss can hardly be repaired. I used to believe that I love Apple, but recently I learned that I love a team consist of Steve Jobs, Scott Forstall, and Jonathan Ive.</p>
<p>After having swept out Steve Jobs, Apple still had an opportunity to recover, because it was the prologue era of computer industry's rising. Having left Apple, Steve Jobs founded NeXT and beat Macintoshes down. Eventually Steve Jobs got back to Apple through the acquirement.</p>
<p>Perhaps Scott Forstall will create an epic as next NeXT, but now there isn't an opportunity like that. While video games are almost for Windows and PS and XBOX, professional creative productivity tools like Photoshop and AutoCAD are almost for Mac, and server softwares are almost for Linux and UNIX. There is no point left to cut in for Scott Forstall.</p>
<p>We are watching an invisible war between Scott Forstall and Jonathan Ive. After Scott Forstall's formally leaving Apple, it will be declared, also invisibly.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to next NeXT.</p>
