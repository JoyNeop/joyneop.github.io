<p>Up to the sky it is blue</p>
<p>Down to the ground pieces of chalk</p>
<p>Those years have drawn over their ends</p>
<p>I still remember the paper boat in the river</p>
<br />
<p>In the desk there lied a few papers</p>
<p>Playground there were lines of white chalks</p>
<p>Every noon walking around three circles</p>
<p>That was the song of our youth</p>
<br />
<p>Still remember the three years</p>
<p>Counting down to the day of end</p>
<p>Recalling your face of the age</p>
<p>As if the past presents</p>
<p>At the time we were not alone</p>
<p>Promised to climb the hill</p>
<p>Although many years has passed</p>
<p>You are always together with me</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Far away the horizon under skyline</p>
<p>Written the memorial after separated</p>
<p>Memory of the past has been dried</p>
<p>I still remember rainbow after rain</p>
<br />
<p>The eave we've be under when rain poured</p>
<p>Playground fully covered by gingko leaves</p>
<p>Shoulder with shoulder when school's over</p>
<p>That was the picture can't show once more</p>
<br />
<p>Still remember the three years</p>
<p>Counting down to the day of end</p>
<p>Recalling your face of the age</p>
<p>As if the past presents</p>
<p>At the time we were not alone</p>
<p>Promised to climb the hill</p>
<p>Although many years has passed</p>
<p>You are always together with me</p>
<br />
<p>Those three years we enjoyed together</p>
<p>Now only memory retains its place</p>
