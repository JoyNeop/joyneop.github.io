<p>The superposition of high and low mood state finally came. The dark skyrim tells something about some sort of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Wearing the uniform which has been unfamiliar, I walked in the air washed by the rain in last night. Temperature fell down; it doesn't disagree with the green of the ground. Walk some streets. Sang some songs. I felt tired. Last night I slept early; it didn't help.</p>
<p>I don't want to depict the rain; nor to sorrow about the past. I wrote something heavy enough last autumn. Maybe I will be sad like this again one year later. There was happiness in these years despite the pain, while the happy part was not in the school. However the pain engraves deeply along with aging. I tried to seize the time; they ran faster then.</p>
