<p>The dance show in Jun 2, 2013 was successful and Muhuan Lee got famous among grade 10 students. The only pity was that my posters weren't printed and presented in front of all people in school.</p>
<p>And I have read The Dark Templar Saga: Firstborn, which is a sci-fi story based on StarCraft and written by Christie Golden. I followed Jacob Jefferson Ramsey who will inherit the entire knowledge of Protoss from Zamara, the Preserver whose soul was injected into Jacob's brain. Zamara told Jacob the history via dreams, that how Savassan, known as Khas, the bringer of order, who ended Aeon Of Strife, rediscovered the ancient knowledge from Xel'Naga and forgotten by Protoss. Khala, the path to order, was come up with by Savassan, fused the Protoss into one. Lyric is poor, but becomes moving if mixed with additional music and voice. The comparison was from Jacob. I am looking forward to sinking into the other two books of following story. I am convinced that it must be fascinating. This nook was supposed to be read completely at the end of my secondary school life previously, because of my lack of confidence in reading English text. Yet to my surprise, I finished it one year earlier.</p>
<p>Then in the following three days' break, maybe I will read the biography of Steve Jobs, as a challenge for me. Also maybe not. I bought many book on Amazon for 51% discount for all books on Jun 1, 2013.</p>
