<p>I had never imagined my life would be like this. Going far from the original plan, getting more than expected loneness, and working so hard for living. Two persons I know have been going on this way, <a href="https://jysperm.me/2014/02/1493/" target="_blank">JySperm</a> and <a href="http://www.ricter.me" target="_blank">Ricter</a>, but, it's so dramatic happening to me.</p>
<p>In one word, I decided to stay at Beijing, without a degree.</p>
<p>Originally, the plan was to have an internship experience which can be written in my resume, to avoid being embarrassed for large blank when providing it. However, circumstances changed.</p>
<p>Regarding my intermediate IELTS score and lack in standardized tests, the best Bachelor education I would be able to receive in the United States would not be good <em>enough</em>. That means, it would not worth more than working experience of the same span. In addition, the financial risk was too high to be ignored. My parents were not financially robust enough to support my education and living during the upcoming four years.</p>
<p>My profession is not computer science; it's human-interface design and graphic design. Having consulted a few friends about employment-based immigration, the difficulty to stay in the United States for college graduates from China majoring non-STEM fields rose to me. Even if I will finish my education with no pain, even if the cost will be covered by my parents effortlessly, it will still be a hard job to obtain my green card.</p>
<p>I failed this way, the most popular way in China, of immigrating to the United States â€” to receive a degree and get a job there. I've been reworking on a new plan. Our company has been planing to relocate to Silicon Valley, to actually realize the purpose, "<em>push ideas into reality</em>". We've registered a few domain names that may be used for the international brand, and dual-language has been listed in the development roadmap.</p>
<p>Wish my future be there.</p>
