<p>The eighteenth birthday is coming soon.</p>
<p>Decades later, who shall drop tear aside whom, and who shall lay beneath whose flowers? Centuries later, humans remember me because of you, or remember you because of me? Millenniums later, our physical forms and information produced shall vanish in the history; how shall our influences fade?</p>
<p>If you leave me alive alone, I don't know how can I live further than your death. Wandering at the busy yet spacious streetsides; listing your yasashii voice echoing. If I leave you alive alone, I cannot allow the pain ruling over you. Gazing at my <em>image</em> every day; scrolling from side to side on the bed where I don't exist every night.</p>
<p>I am atheist. There's no god blessing me; no Jesus loving me. The heaven doesn't welcome me. By the time I cut and nullified them, I accepted to go nowhere after death.</p>
<p>The order to die is not determined by us. The nature shall reserve the power.</p>
<p>Death shall finally come; it's the ultimate ending. I feel so happy, to <strong>live</strong> with you.</p>
