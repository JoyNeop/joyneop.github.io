<p>This morning I got my report of the pretest, which shows that my ability is fine and I can get 5.0 after these courses, and I have a high possibility to get 5.5 as well.</p>
<p>Then I took my first speaking class and first listening class here. Liang Wang and Xiaoli Ma are my speaking teachers and Ou Lee is my listening teacher. In the listening test provided by Ou Lee, I worked out 29 out of 40, and got 6.5 in total. This is encouraging.</p>
<p>And I got my room, and started to live with an international student, a Muslim, from Tajikistan. He told me that being naked in front of others in his religion is not a good behavior, after my taking a shower.</p>
<p>I understand the future is coming.</p>
