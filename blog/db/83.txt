<p>Today morning I got my report of the pretest, which indicates that my ability is fine and I can get 5.0 after these courses, and I have a high possibility to get 5.5 as well.</p>
<p>Then I took the first speaking class and the first listening class. Liang Wang and Xiaoli Ma are my speaking teachers and Ou Lee is my listening teacher. In the listening test provided by Ou Lee, I worked out 29 out of 40, and got 6.5 in total. This is encouraging.</p>
<p>And I got my room, and started to live with an international student from Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The future is coming.</p>
