<p>After having taken my first IELTS test, I came back to Liaoyang yesterday.</p>
<p>The two months flew by quickly, yet it's still a question how much my English skills have been developed. It is common sense that most people can hardly get ideal score at the first time, as same as TOEFL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have not decided to continue preparing for IELTS or to go for TOEFL yet. I am not sure does the style of TOEFL match my current knowledge structure and how much has to be rebuilt. I makes great cost to transfer form IELTS to TOEFL, as same as to transfer from studying abroad to preparing for China University Entrance Exam.</p>
<p>I am either not sure how long will I stay in Liaoyang this period, maybe two days maybe one week, or even longer.</p>
<p>Now I am sitting in the classroom of my classic Liaoyang #1 High School, and Mrs Kang, the chemistry teacher, is lecturing. I am int the classroom but not in the lesson. I have lost the ability to take part in such science lessons.</p>
<p>The winter has come, but my future is still covered my mist.</p>
