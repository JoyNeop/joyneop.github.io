<p>To save money on education, I have decided to take AP tests. And get credit redemption. S I arrived in Dalian and started to. Take a series of courses for AP Physics B and Calculus BC.</p>
<p>I rent an underground room for temporarily living near by Ealing,  the private educational institute which provides courses for SAT, AP and others. And it was founded by a friend of my aunt. Though no discount offered, she and one of her staff handled my college application and I can concentrate on my own work.</p>
<p>The room is too cold to sleep in unless electric heating added. Yet e real problem is, there is no space for a desk so I cannot write in the room. Now I am writing in KFC.</p>
<p>The location is quite convenient, because it is near to both Ealing and downtown. </p>
