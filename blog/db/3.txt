<p>It's raining. Again.</p>
<p>People in cities cannot enjoy complete rainy days, as is said and believed. However, urban rains are stylish in another way. Tarmac streets are not same ageful as slate ways, but have something different. Buildings covered by buildings, shadows covered by shadows; it's what cannot be seen in countryside.</p>
<p>The sky was masked grayscale, light and shadows turn in turn. Sunless; moonless; starless.</p>
<p>The rain reminded me somebody, who I used to be interested in for sex and relationship since fall of 2011, but a straight guy unfortunately. He must have heard of me, according to his react when associating my name and face.</p>
<p>The hand script of the lyric which was written to him was lost by him. Since then, I should have understood I'm just a stranger in his mind, for he didn't care about it.</p>
<p>No more enthusiasm toward him.</p>
