<p>After the incredibly huge wave of discussion about iOS 7's changes on GUI, people eventually take another breath to care about OS X Mavericks. From the publicly showed glimpses of it, The trend of flat style has also appeared on OS X. The background tile images of Notification Center, Dashboard, and Launchpad folders, have got replaced, or disappeared. OS X is going to be flatter.</p>
<p>I hate flat style. I was born this way.</p>
<p>What if interact with a machine without even at least visual comparing? What if touch a screen without even at least one familiar element? I cannot imagine it, nor accept it. What a nightmare.</p>
<p>Then, what if OS X eventually gets as flat as iOS 7 or even more terrible? Beyond imagination. In case of that, I have to build my own OS, which is temporarily named "NeOPSTEP".</p>
<p>Ideally, I hope that NeOPSTEP is an FreeBSD-based OS of GNU/Linux, or directly powered with OpenDarwin. Yet I am not a coder so I cannot create an OS with only these fundamental wheels. So NeOPSTEP can only disappointingly be based on Linux, for personalizing on Linux is easier. And Debian is recommended for me because it is light and easy-learning.</p>
<p>Before creating my fork, I have got down to design the GUI. My purpose is to inherit the style from Tiger to Mountain Lion, but I cannot simply copy these because of copyright issue. Right now I have published the default desktop picture on Behance, which is similar to the one of Mac OS X Tiger.</p>
<p>When Apple decides to betray us, I stand out to preserve our dream.</p>
