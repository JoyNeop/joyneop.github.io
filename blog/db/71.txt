<p>After the incredibly huge wave of discussion about iOS 7's changes on GUI, people eventually take another breath to care about OS X Mavericks. From the public introduction and preview of it, The trend of flat design has also appeared on OS X. The background tile images of Notification Center, Dashboard, and Launchpad folders, have got replaced, or disappeared. OS X is going to be flatter.</p>
<p>I hate flat.</p>
<p>What if interact with a machine without even at least one visual metaphor? What if touch a screen without even at least one familiar element? I cannot imagine it, nor accept it. What a nightmare.</p>
<p>Then, what if OS X eventually gets as flat as iOS 7 or even more terrible? Beyond imagination. In case of that, I have to build my own OS, temporarily named NeOPSTEP.</p>
<p>Ideally, I hope that NeOPSTEP is a FreeBSD-based OS, or directly powered with OpenDarwin. Yet I am not a programmer so I may or may not be able to create an OS with only these fundamental wheels. It will take time to investigate and find the right wheels.</p>
<p>Before creating my fork, I have got started to design the GUI. My purpose is to inherit the style from Mac OS X Tiger to OS X Mountain Lion, but I cannot simply copy those because of copyright issue. Right now I am working on the default desktop picture, which is similar to the Aqua Blue of Mac OS X Tiger.</p>
<p>When we are decided to betray, I stand out and fight for our faith.</p>
