<p>For half decade I have been using the name "Joy Neop", but I will hopefully get rid of it half decade later.</p>
<p><em>Selection of symbol is arbitrary.</em> When my age was around 14, I happened to create an alias name for myself, to be different from my legal name which was not in my control. And it was this one, an <em>[almost] English</em> name.</p>
<p>As years past, the name happened to be a bit problematic. Not only because this first name is supposed to be exclusive for female users in the prejudice of certain arrogant anglophone people, but I am not really fond of the first-last convention. As I have noticed, the last name component is simply a mark of Y chromosome, and the origins of common last names are usually locations (e.g. Yamada), jobs (e.g. Smith), and objects (e.g. Einstein).</p>
<p>I then started to examine the necessity of last names. And my conclusion is that the last name component has no necessity. I want good Greek days back; I prefer to follow great ancient spirits like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>I respect no tradition, patriot no civilization, exemplify no species, and acknowledge no origin. Per my dasein, the first subjectivity <em>a priori</em>.</p>
<p>Now, my draft of desired name has become "Neruthes". The new name has no etymological origin, as same to the preceding one.</p>
