<p>For half decade I have been using the name "Joy Neop", but I will hopefully get rid of it half decade later.</p>
<p><em>Selection of symbol is arbitrary.</em> When I was around 14, I happened to create an alias name for myself, to be different from my legal name which I couldn't say anything. And it was this one, an <em>[almost] English</em> name.</p>
<p>As years past, the name happened to be a bit embarrassing. Not only because this first name is supposed to be exclusive for female users, but I am not really fond of the first-last convention. As I have noticed, the last name component is simply a mark of Y chromosome, and the origins of common last names are usually locations (e.g. Yamada), jobs (Smith), and objects (Einstein).</p>
<p>I then started to be confused of the necessity of last names. And my conclusion is that the last name component has 0 necessity. I want good Greek days back; I want to follow great ancient spirits like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>Eventually, my draft of desired name has become "Neruthes". And it is as same as the preceding one, in terms of absence of etymological root.</p>
