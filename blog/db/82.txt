<p>Today, I have arrived at Shenyang. In the following two months, I will take a 160-hour English course for the IELTS. After having considered the situation, I finally decided to prepare for IELTS rather than TOEFL.</p>
<p>At 10:00, we four students took a pretest intending to figure out our current abilities, which allows them to design the entire plan.</p>
<p>The first section was speaking. A lady sat in front of me. She came up with the first question, or to say topic, the brand of my phone.</p>
<p>We then took the listening section, reading section, and writing section. The listening section was a conversation between a student and a clerk in bookstore, discussing discount policy for students. The article was about the construction of Snowy Mountain Scheme, a hydro-electric power station in Australia. Finally the writing section was to describe a graph exposing the wheat exports of European Community, Australia, and Canada, from 1985 to 1990. It was not a good performance.</p>
<p>After lunch, we got to the agency which had handled my applications. My mother and I talked with Mr Xing about my destinations, and chose several universities. I asked if it would be ok for me to apply for universities ranked such high, considering I won't take SAT, and seemingly my IELTS score won't be greater than 6. He convinced me that they could manage it. And I registered for the IELTS on Dec 14, 2013.</p>
<p>Several years later, today will be considered as my most essential day in 2013, even in my entire lifetime.</p>
