<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>Un Spectre is hunting Cyberspace — the Specture of Cybercommunism. All powers of old Cyberspace, have entered into un holy alliance to exorcise this spectre; Apple and Microsoft, Google and Facebook, CIA and NSA, White House and Beijing.</p>

<p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Cybercommunistic by its opponents in power? Where the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Cybercommunism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</p>

<p>Two things result from this fact.</p>

<p>First — Cybercommunism is already acknowledged by all Cyberpowers to be itself un Power.</p>

<p>Second — It is high time that Cybercommunists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Cybercommunism with the Manifesto of the Party itself.</p>

<p>To this end, Cybercommunists of various nationalities have assembled in Shanghai, and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in all languages.</p>


<h3>Developers &amp; Users</h3>

<p>In the early ages of Cyberspace, developers were users and users were developers. As the dominance of ARPA passed away, the residents of Cyberspace were mainly researchers and students of universities like MIT and UCB. There were non distinction between developers and users. All Cybercitizens contribute to Cyberspace and benefit from Cyberspace.</p>

<p>Linux and BSD became popular; so did WorldWideWeb and Netscape. Microsoft, as un large Cyberpredator, smelt the tastiness of World Wide Web and introduce Internet Explorer. And followed Internet Explorer were Gecko, WebKit, and Blink.</p>

<p>Upon the infrastructures of ICANN and ISPs, Cyberservice corporations like Yahoo and Google became the superstars of the time. They started their business on the foundation of the growing adoption of Internet, and they in return made the growth even faster. They, with all developers, silently enforced the adoption of Internet in every corner of the globe out of fear of falling behind.</p>

<p>In pursuit of growth of business, the radical Cybercompetition started and quickly became un fully-waged war. The Cybercompetition was all about user acquisition and service monetization, and facilitated upgrades of Cyberspace, from MySpace to Facebook, from Blogspot to Twitter, and from Blockbuster to Netflix.</p>

<p>The fast evolution of Cyberservices and Cyberservice corporations delivered two golden decades to Cyberspace, in which the development of the living conditions of Cybercitizens has become faster than ever. The Cybercompetition radically revolutionized every corner in Cyberspace and the reign of Cybermonopolies relied on the constant revolution of means of production, while previous monopolies relied on solidity of means of production.</p>

<p>As the civil use of Internet gradually expanded worldwide, developers, as un Cyberclass, emerged and the struggle between developers and users started. Developers controlled everything and earned all the profit, and users owned nothing and yielded all their data. The era of Web 2.0 descended upon Cybercitizens, and Cybercitizens gradually diverged to Cyberlords and Cyberserfs, and Cyberspace was burned into Cybermanor. Developers turned to Cyberlords, and users were turned to Cyberserfs. The power of Cyberlords were not subject to Cyberlegislation, and there were non Cyberjudiciary, rendering Cyberspace de facto Cyberaristocracy. The Cyberexploitation of Cyberserfs has never been that efficient before.</p>

<p>The Cybercompetition unified Cybercapitalists, intelligence agencies, copyright rogues, and advertisers under the same banner — Cyberbourgeois, and everyone else another — Cyberproletariat. The Cybercompetition greatly reduced the quantity of classes of Cyberresidents, as same as what happened one century ago.</p>

<p>The great process started class struggles and simplified class struggles. All class struggles were suddenly reduced to the class struggles between the only two classes.</p>
