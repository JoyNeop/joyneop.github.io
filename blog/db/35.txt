<p>If you feel tired</p>
<p>If you shed tears</p>
<p>Stop sorrowing</p>
<p>Stop to stand up</p>
<p>Bring your eyes up to the sky</p>
<p>And find what is real</p>
<br />
<p>Entire human on the world</p>
<p>Not everyone knows you</p>
<p>They disagree</p>
<p>They against</p>
<p>They criticize</p>
<p>They attack</p>
<br />
<p>Ignore them</p>
<p>Out of mind, out of influence</p>
<p>Because your life is yours</p>
<p>Do what you want to do</p>
<p>Be what you want to be</p>
