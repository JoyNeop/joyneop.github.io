<p>For budgeting my higher education, I decided to take AP to get credit redemption. So, I arrived in Dalian to take two AP courses, Physics B and Calculus BC.</p>
<p>I rent an underground room for temporarily living near by Ealing, the private educational institute which provides courses for SAT, AP and others. And it was founded by a friend of my aunt. Though no discount offered, she and one of her staff handled my college application thus I can concentrate on my own work.</p>
<p>The room is too cold to sleep in, unless electric heating added. But the real problem is, there is no space for a desk so I cannot write in the room. Now I am writing in KFC. The location is quite convenient; it is near to both Ealing and downtown. </p>
