<!-- <p>For the first time in forever,</p>
<p>I feel I can be the master of my life.</p>
<p>Although it might be an illusion,</p>
<p>But I will not give up.</p>
<p>I will dominate my life to the maximum extent possible.</p>

<br />

<p>You've forbidden me to die.</p>
<p>I'll live; I know it's difficult, but I will try.</p>
<p>I came from the gutter of poverty and hopelessness;</p>
<p>I was lost in the valley of the night,</p>
<p>But I will climb to the light.</p>

<br />

<p>I was wretched of the gutter but you kindled my flame of life.</p>
<p>Even the darkest night has ended and the sun has risen.</p>
<p>I now live again in freedom,</p>
<p>In the pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>In the joint future we'll create together.</p>

<br />

<p>Do you hear tears of mine,</p>
<p>Crying for the rebirth you gave me?</p>
<p>It is a music of a spirit who will not live deadly again!</p>

<br />

<p>This I swear to you,</p>
<p>That I will bravely live till the last moment of the life,</p>
<p>Either with or without your company.</p>

<br />

<aside>
My answer to the meaning of the life is that there is no meaning granted by a greater being and thus one has to find his own way to satisfy his psychological demand for reason to live. And now I find my way can be exactly as sung: to love another person.
