<p>In this month, I took TOEFL fundamentals course at XDF Dalian. Not sure about the result; it fulfilled me in the period anyway. I was living with cousins these days. In spare time I occasionally participated in the UI design of the web version of HumansMap. Had no time to read novels that I took there, predictably.</p>
<p>It was a few days earlier than the original schedule to get back to Liaoyang. It was not idle. I was working on designs that with or without inspiration, and was preparing for post-vacation stuff. I don't know how will new head teacher react to my empty homework.</p>
<p>The last year is coming. Who knows what shall the future be.</p>
